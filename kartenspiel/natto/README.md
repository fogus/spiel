*Natto* is a climbing game played with Mah Jong style tiles for two players.

Preparation
===========

To play *Natto* the way that it's meant to be played (with lots of clacking), you'll need a set of the following Rum-Jong tiles:

![]()

You can also use a Mhing deck, Mah Jong tiles, or a standard deck (1-9 of three suits, 10s of missing suit for flowers, 2 sets of face cards for wilds).

The deal
========

Before shuffling, remove all of the wild cards and give each player a left, center, and right facing dragon.  The remaining tiles are placed face down on a surface and shuffled around.  Each player is dealt 13 tiles, with the remaining 5 left out and not shown to either player.

Ranks
=====

In *Natto* both the cards themselves and their suits are ranked.

## Tile ranks

The tile ranks are as follows:

![]()

That is, the tiles rank from lowest to highest as: flower, 1-9, flower, left facing dragon, center facing dragon, right facing dragon. That's right, the flower cards can be used as either a zero or a ten.

## Ranked suits

The suits are also ranked:

![]()

That is, the square suit along with the right-facing dragon are the highest, the triangles along with the center-facing dragon are next, and finally the circles with the left-facing dragon are the lowest.  The flower cards do not have a suit per se, but instead take on the suit required to fulfill a sequence.

## Wild dragons

The dragon cards serve dual purposes, but the most immediate is that they are wild cards.  They can serve as any rank, including those 

Goal
====

The first player to exhaust their hand first in 3 rounds is the winner of the game.  You may also play to the best of 5, 7, 9, or even 777 rounds if you so desire.  It's your life.

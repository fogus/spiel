*Natto* is a climbing game played with Mah Jong style tiles for two players.

Preparation
===========

To play *Natto* the way that it's meant to be played (with lots of clacking), you'll need a set of the following Rum-Jong tiles:

You can also use a Mhing deck, Mah Jong tiles, or a standard deck (1-9 of three suits, 10s of missing suit for flowers, 2 sets of face cards for wilds).

The deal
========

Before shuffling, remove all of the wild cards and give each player a left, center, and right facing dragon.  The remaining tiles are placed face down on a surface and shuffled around.  Each player is dealt 13 tiles, with the remaining 5 left out and not shown to either player.

Ranks
=====

In *Natto* both the cards themselves and their suits are ranked.

## Tile ranks

The tile ranks are as follows:

![ranks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fogus/spiel/master/kartenspiel/natto/graphics/ranks.png)

That is, the tiles rank from lowest to highest as: flower, 1-9, flower, left facing dragon, center facing dragon, right facing dragon. That's right, the flower cards can be used as either a zero or a ten.

## Hierarchical suits

*Natto* suits are hierarchical:

![suits](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fogus/spiel/master/kartenspiel/natto/graphics/ranked-suits.png)

That is, the square suit along with the right-facing dragon are the highest, the triangles along with the center-facing dragon are next, and finally the circles with the left-facing dragon are the lowest.  The flower cards do not have a suit per se, but instead take on the suit required to fulfill a sequence.

## Wild dragons

The dragon cards serve dual purposes, but the most immediate is that they are wild cards.  They can serve as any rank, including non-existent ranks above or below the flower cards.  Dragons may only serve as wild cards for their associated suits or as bombs, described next.

## Bombs

There are six bombs in *Natto, shown below:

When played, bombs beat any regular combination and any lower-ranked bomb.

Goal
====

The first player to exhaust their hand first in 3 rounds is the winner of the game.  You may also play to the best of 5, 7, 9, or even 777 rounds if you so desire.  It's your life.

Game-play
=========

Players attempt to win a number of tricks consisting of alternating turns playing special card combinations called sets, seqs, sums, tubes, or plates, each higher than the next.  Whenever a player cannot best a played combination the player who played the last combination wins the trick.  The player who won the last trick starts the next trick and so on until one player exhausts all of the cards in their hand.

## Sets

Sets are a group of 1-6 cards of the same rank including wild dragons.  A set can be bested by a set of the same size with a higher rank:

And as you see, a set can be beat by the same rank of a higher suit.



 * seqs 3+ cards in sequence
 * tubes - 3 consecutive pairs in natural order
 * plates - 2 consecutive triples in natural order
 * layoffs are an extra card added to 3-card set
   - pure sets, not wildcard sets

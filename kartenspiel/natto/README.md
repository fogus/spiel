*Natto* is a climbing game played with Mah Jong style tiles for two players.

Preparation
===========

To play *Natto* the way that it's meant to be played (with lots of clacking), you'll need a set of the following Rum-Jong tiles:

![]()

You can also use a Mhing deck, Mah Jong tiles, or a standard deck (1-9 of three suits, 10s of missing suit for flowers, 2 sets of face cards for wilds).

The deal
========

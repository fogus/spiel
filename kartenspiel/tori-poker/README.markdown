*Tori Poker* is a traditional card game inspired by Texas Hold Em Poker using only 17 cards, for 2-4 players.  

Setup and deal
==============

*Tori Poker* is played with a standard 52-card deck with all cards removed except those in the suit of hearts and the 4, 7, 10, and King of Spades.  Each player is given some number of chips to start -- the amount is up to the players involved.  One player is chosen as the dealer, who then deals three cards to each player.

Gameplay
========

A game of *Tori Poker* is played over the course of a number of rounds.  The number of rounds in a game doesn't matter and can be limited or expanded as the participants desire.  Each rounds consists of a number of stages:

 * Hands are dealt
 * Card buy-in occurs
 * Community cards are revealed, with bets interspersed
 * Hands are revealed
 * Chips are paid

Each of these stages will be described below:

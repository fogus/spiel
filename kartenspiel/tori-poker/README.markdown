*Tori Poker* is a traditional card game inspired by Texas Hold Em Poker using only 17 cards, for 2-4 players.  

Setup and deal
==============

*Tori Poker* is played with a standard 52-card deck with all cards removed except those in the suit of hearts and the 4, 7, 10, and King of Spades.  Each player is given some number of chips to start -- the amount is up to the players involved.  One player is chosen as the dealer, who then deals two cards to each player.

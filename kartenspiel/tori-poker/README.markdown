*Tori Poker* is a traditional card game inspired by Texas Hold Em Poker using only 17 cards, for 2-4 players.  

Setup and deal
==============

*Tori Poker* is played with a standard 52-card deck with all cards removed except those in the suit of hearts and the 4, 7, 10, and King of Spades.  Each player is given some number of chips to start -- the amount is up to the players involved.  One player is chosen as the dealer, who then deals three cards to each player.

Gameplay
========

A game of *Tori Poker* is played over the course of a number of rounds.  The number of rounds in a game doesn't matter and can be limited or expanded as the participants desire.  Each rounds consists of a number of stages:

 * Hands are dealt
 * Card buy-in occurs
 * Community cards are revealed, with bets interspersed
 * Hands are revealed
 * Chips are paid

Each of these stages will be described below:

The deal
--------

To start a round each player is dealt three cards face down in front of them.  The players cannot look at their cards until they buy them from their reserve of chips.

Card buy-in
-----------

In order to look at their cards players must "buy" them.  What this means is that a player can pay some pre-determined number of chips to the pot (5% of their starting amount works well) for the priviledge of looking at one of their face-down cards.  Therefore, to look at all three starting cards requires three payments of the pre-determined amount to the pot.  This buy-in occurs in a clockwise-fashion starting with the player to the left of the dealer.

A player can buy each card one at a time or all at once.  Likewise, a player can fold after buying any number of their starting cards.  When a player buys their cards none of the other players should see them.  Bought cards can be held in a player's hand or placed on the table.

If all but one player folds in the buy-in phase then the reamining player gest the pot, otherwise the game continues as follows.

Community card reveal and betting
---------------------------------

Once players have bought their cards the community cards are revealed to allow for betting.  The community cards are a set of three cards revealed one at a time to a common pool of cards.  These common cards can be used by all of the players to build their best possible 5-card hands.  As each community card is revealed a round of betting (and possibly folding) occurs leading up the the revelation of the remaining players' hands.

The reveal
----------

Once all of the community cards have been revealed and the corresponding betting has occured, the players will reveal their hands.  The player with the best hand built from their three hand cards and 2 of the 3 community cards wins the pot.  If more than one player has equally strong hands then the pot is split amongst them.

The *Tori Poker* deck
=====================

As mentioned, the *Tori Poker* deck contains onely 17 cards consisting of 13 standard playing cards (of the hearts suit) and 4 wild cards (4, 7, 10, and King of spades).  The suit of the wild cards is unimportant and as a result the cards should be considered a single suit.  Therefore, the dynamics of building Poker-like hands is simpler and less rich in possibilities by design.

Wild cards
----------

Although the spades suit is used for the wild cards, the suit does not matter in the least.  Instead, the rank of the card is the important feature of the wild cards.  That is, the rank of the wild cards describe how they're constrained in standing in for any given card in a hand.

Normally, wild cards can stand in for any card in a hand, but in *Tori Poker* the ranks determine the range of cards that a wild card can stand in for.  That is, the rank of a wild card says that it can stand in for any other card of that rank or lower.  For example, the 4-wild can only stand in for the 4, 3, 2, and low-Ace, but the King-wild can stand in for every card except the high-Ace.

The Ace
-------

The Aces in *Tori Poker* can be used in a hand as either a low-card (a 1) or a high-card, but not both at the same time.  The Ace as a high card can never be substitued for using a wild card.  However, with the use of a wild card and an Ace a hand could be considered having both a low and a high Ace.  

Ranking of possible hands
-------------------------

 * High card
 * A sum
 * A multiplication
 * Two of a kind
 * Straight
 * Three of a kind
 * Four of a kind
 * Five of a kind
 * Royal flush (with wild)
 * Royal flush (without wild)

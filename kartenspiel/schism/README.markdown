*Schism* is a trick-taking traditional card game with trumps and chips for 2-6 players.  

Setup and deal
==============

*Schism* is played with a standard 52-card deck. Each player is given 20 chips to start (for a shorter game, use only 10 each). One player is chosen as the dealer to start, who then deals 5 cards to each player in clockwise order.

Gameplay
========

A game of *Schism* consists of some number of rounds, each round consisting of 2 hands of 5 tricks each.  The first hand is known as the "stand" and the second the "fall."  A trick is led by the player to the left of the dealer and proceeds clockwise around the table, each player placing a card.  The top card of the undealt stock determines the trump suit for the hand.  The player who lays the highest card in the trick or the highest trump card wins the trick.  Whoever won the last trick leads the next trick.

The Stand
---------

The first hand in a round is called the "stand" and the goal is to win the most tricks.  The player who wins the "stand" is allowed to pick any card from the trick for use in the second hand of the round.  All of the players except the one who won the trick must place 1 chip from their reserve into a common pile in the middle of the table, this is called debt.

The Fall
--------

Once the "stand" hand is complete the cards not taken as the reward for the winners are discarded and cards from the stock are dealt back to the players in clockwise order.  Only enough cards are given to each player to fill their hand back up to 5 cards.  Again, the top card of the undealt stock is used to determine the trump suit.  

The goal of the "fall" is to win the least tricks.  Tricks proceed as normal for this round starting again with the player to the left of the dealer.  All of the players who did not win the trick can reach into the common pile accumulated in the "stand" and take one chip and place it into their "vault."  Chips from the vault can never be used to pay a debt, but they will come into play when tallying the final score.

Winning the game
----------------

*note: the scoring is a work-in-progress*

The player who has nearest to 20 chips (vault plus reserve) when the game ends wins.  In the event of a tie, the player who is closest to 20 with a total higher than 20 wins. If there is still a tie then the tied players play some number of additional rounds until the tie is broken.

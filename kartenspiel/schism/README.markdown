*Schism* is a trick-taking traditional card game with trumps and chips for 2-6 players.  The game is played with a standard 52-card deck.  One player is chosen as the dealer to start and deals 5 cards to each player in clockwise order.  


Each player is given 20 chips to start and the player who has nearest to 20 wins.  In the event of a tie, the player who is closest to 20 with a total less than 20 wins.  If there is still a tie then the tied players play some number of additional hands until the tie is broken.

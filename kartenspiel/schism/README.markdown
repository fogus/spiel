*Schism* is a trick-taking traditional card game with trumps and chips for 2-6 players.  

Setup and deal
==============

*Schism* is played with a standard 52-card deck. Each player is given 20 chips to start. One player is chosen as the dealer to start and deals 5 cards to each player in clockwise order.

Goal
====

The player who has nearest to 20 chips when the game ends wins.  In the event of a tie, the player who is closest to 20 with a total less than 20 wins. If there is still a tie then the tied players play some number of additional rounds until the tie is broken.

Gameplay
========

A game of *Schism* consists of some number of rounds, each round consisting of 2 hands of 5 tricks each.  The first hand is known as the "stand" and the second the "fall."  A trick is led by the player to the left of the dealer and proceeds clockwise around the table, each player placing a card.  The led card determines the trump suit for the hand.  The player who lays the highest card in the trick or the highest trump card wins the trick.

The Stand
---------

The first hand in a round is called the "stand" and the goal is to win the most tricks.  The player who wins the "stand" is allowed to pick any card from the trick for use in the second hand of the round.  All of the players except the one who won the trick must place 1 chip into a common pile in the middle of the table.

The Fall
--------

Once the "stand" hand is complete the cards remaining in the trick (i.e. not taken as the reward for the winners) are reshuffled and dealt back to the players in clockwise order.  Only enough cards are given to each player to fill their hand back up to 5 cards.  The goal of the "fall" is to win the least tricks.  Tricks proceed as normal for this round.

Scoring

After each round the players take the number of tricks won in the

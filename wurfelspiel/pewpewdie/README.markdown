*Pew Pew, Die* is the martian equivalent of Rock, Paper, Scissors
typically played using a specially marked cube often passed through the
ages from one family generation to the next. The game piece, often known
as a pyramid die (or colloquially a “pew-pew die” whereby the game's
name is derived) is marked on each side with one or two triangular
symbols, each named uniquely:

The power ranking for each of the die faces starts with the puppy and
ends with the juggernaut. What this means for gameplay is explained
below.

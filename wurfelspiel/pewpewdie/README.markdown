*Pew Pew, Die* is the martian equivalent of Rock, Paper, Scissors
typically played using a specially marked cube often passed through the
ages from one family generation to the next. The game piece, often known
as a pyramid die (or colloquially a "pew-pew die" whereby the game's
name is derived) is marked on each side with one or two triangular
symbols, each named uniquely:

  The power ranking for each of the die faces starts with the puppy and
ends with the juggernaut. What this means for gameplay is explained
below.

Gameplay
--------

Each players starts with the pew-pew die in his or her hand and mixes it
around in their palm before starting. Facing one another, the players
open their hands revealing the die faces. Each player can then twist
their die up to 90-degrees either clockwise or counter-clockwise to
orient the faces into a desired attack and defense configuration. The
players then determine the result of the initial round and then make
moves from this initial setup to conclude the game. For each round
thereafter a player's die can only be changed in the following ways:

-   A die can be 90-degrees clockwise or counter-clockwise
-   or a die can be flipped onto its front (the side closest the
    opponent), left or right sides
	
	Play proceeds for as many rounds as the players desire, up to a
	pre-determined number of wins -- typically three works best. Details of
attack and defensive mechanics and "life-points" follows.

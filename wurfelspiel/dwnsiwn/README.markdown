*Dwnsiwn* (pronounced Duneshoon) is a game of pyramid construction for two players using a [Spiel Mini](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/110073/spiel-mini) set, designed by [Reinhold Wittig](http://www.perlhuhn.de/).

Preparation
===========

Each player gets 10 dice of differing colors, however a single color can be used if desired.  Once the dice have been allocated, each player rolls all of the dice at the same time.  The numbers rolled will constitute the values available for play.

If the players use a larger  [Das Spiel](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2229/spiel) set then only the cells on a point 4x4x4 cells large are used.

Goal
====

To have the most points on the majority of the three pyramid faces.

Gameplay
========

The players take alternating turns consisting of one of the following actions:

 * Capture a die
 * Place a die
 * Pass
 
The player taking a turn can pick only one of the actions on her turn.  Likewise, a player can only pass if they've run out of dice to play before the other player has.

Capture
-------

To capture, a player can add the values showing on the faces of two or more of their dice to equal the value on a single opponent die.  The dice used to capture are then re-rolled and given to the opponent.  Likewise, the die captured is taken into the capturing player's stock and dice and also re-rolled.  If you're using dice of the same color then just put the captured and capturing dice aside apart from the others.

Both players are ultimately responsible for placing dice for their opponent according to the placement rules explained next.

Placing
-------

The dice that a player has in stock must all be placed on the pyramid.  When placing a die it must *always* be placed such that its face value is showing on one of the pyramid sides.  The placements continue until all of the dice have been added to the pyramid.  However, the rules for placement require that certain other edges must also show in certain multi-side placements.

### Multi-side placements

That is, if the placement of a die will show multiple faces (i.e. on a corner or the apex) then a second showing face must adhere to the following rules:

  - If the die belongs to the placing player then the second face must 
    be the smallest face on the perpendicular edge.

For example, if a player wishes to place his die showing a `6` on a corner space then that `6` must show on one side and a `1`, since it's the smallest perpendicular value, must show on the other pyramid side.

  - If it's an opponent's die that's placed then the second face must
    be the largest face on the perpendicular edge.

For example, if a player wishes to place her opponent's die showing a `2` on a corner space then that `2` must show on one side and a `6`, since it's the largest perpendicular value, must show on the other pyramid side.

The placing player can always decide which side of the pyramid the die values reside.

### The dungeon

There is one exception to the placement rule and that is if a die is placed on the center-most square, named the *dungeon*.  Naturally, the die placed in the dungeon will eventually be buried.  In this case a player will receive zero-points for this die.  However, the dungeon is important should ties occur.

### Scoring

When all of the dice have been placed onto the pyramid the players sum the points showing and any dungeon bonuses to determine the scores for each side.  The player with the highest total on the majority of sides wins the game.  If a tie occurs then the player who took the dungeon wins.

Design notes
============

*Dwnsiwn* is clearly inspired by [Inside](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30179/inside), designed by [Henrik Morast](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/9007/henrik-morast).  It started as a direct adaptation of Inside to a Spiel Mini set, but I found that less than inspiring.  Instead, I tried to use the nature of the Spiel set's dicey nature to inform an Inside-like side-win majority theme.  I hope that I succeeded.

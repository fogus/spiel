Ozymandias is a dice game of pyramidal deconstruction for one to two players using a Das Spiel set.  Ozymandias has much in common with Rummy-style games, but attempts to minimize luck by using the Das Spiel set as a source of matching.

The game consists of alternating turns consisting of two *takes*,
except for the starting player who performs only a single take. A
*take* is the act of removing some number of dice from the edges of
the pyramid and scoring them according to their original orientation
in the structure.

A player may take a group of dice from the pyramid according to
certain scoring sets: runs, 3 of a kind, 4 of a kind, additive
(numbers add to a sum), multiplicative (numbers multiply to a
product), etc..  There are also takes that incur penalties, but
that might be useful for setting up larger scoring sets.

The players will continue to take dice from the pyramid until either
they both take negative scores on successive turns or all of the dice
are removed from the pyramid.  The player with the highest score at
the end is the winner.

Please consider trying Ozymandias if you have a Spiel or Spiel Mini set on hand.

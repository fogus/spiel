**Pidan** is a game of pyramid construction for two players using a Das Spiel set.

Each player starts with 10 dice that form the values available for play.  The game consists of alternating turns where players can take one of three possible actions: infection, placement, or passing.  An infection is the act of swapping two or more dice for one of an opponent's dice.  A placement is the act of putting a die onto the dice pyramid according to a set of specific rules.  A player can only pass if they've run out of dice to play before the other player has.

It's an important aspect of Pidan that the players are ultimately responsible for placing all of the dice in their nest onto the pyramid, including those belonging to their opponent.

When all of the dice have been placed onto the pyramid the players sum the points showing to determine the scores for each side. The player with the highest total on the majority of sides wins the game.  Ties are broken by awarding the player whose die resides in the innermost cell.

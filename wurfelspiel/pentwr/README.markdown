*unnamed* is a game of pyramid construction for two players using either a [Das Spiel](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2229/spiel) or [Spiel Mini](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/110073/spiel-mini) set, both designed by [Reinhold Wittig](http://www.perlhuhn.de/).

Preparation
===========

Each player gets 10 dice of differing colors, however a single color can be used if desired.  Once the dice have been allocated, each player rolls all of the dice at the same time.  The numbers rolled will constitute the values available for play.

Goal
====

To have the most points on the majority of the three dice pyramid faces.

Gameplay
========

The players take alternating turns consisting of one of the following actions:

 * Capture a die
 * Place a die
 
The player taking a turn can pick only one of the actions on her turn.

Capture
-------

To capture, a player can add the values showing on the faces of two or more of their dice to equal the value on a single opponent die.  The dice used to capture are then rerolled and given to the opponent.  Likewise, the die captured is taken into the capturing player's stock and dice and also rerolled.  If you're using dice of the same color then just put the captured and capturing dice aside apart from the others.

Both players are ultimately responsible for placing dice for their opponent according to the placement rules explained next.

Placing
-------

The dice that a player has in stock must all be placed on the pyramid.  When placing a die it must always be placed such that its face value is showing on one of the pyramid sides.  However, the rules for placement require that certain other edges must also show in certain multi-side placements.

That is, if it'll show two or three faces:
    - if it's your die then one must be the smallest 
      face on the perpendicular edge
    - if it's your opponent's die then one must be the
      largest face on the perpendicular edge

### The middle die exception

There is one exception to this rule and that is if a die is placed on the center-most square where naturally the die thus placed will eventually be buried.  

Capture
-------

WIP

- Blue 4 and 2 captures Red 6
- The 6 is rerolled but must eventually be placed by Blue player
- Blue 4 and 2 must be later placed by Red player

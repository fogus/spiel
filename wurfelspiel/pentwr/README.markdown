*unnamed* is a game of pyramid construction for two players using either a [Das Spiel](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2229/spiel) or [Spiel Mini](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/110073/spiel-mini) set, both designed by [Reinhold Wittig](http://www.perlhuhn.de/).

Preparation
===========

Each player gets 10 dice of differing colors, however a single color can be used if desired.  Once the dice have been allocated, each player rolls all of the dice at the same time.  The numbers rolled will constitute the values available for play.

Goal
====

To have the most points on the majority of the three dice pyramid faces.

Gameplay
========

The players take alternating turns consisting of one of the following actions:

 * Capture a die
 * Place a die
 * Pass
 
The player taking a turn can pick only one of the actions on her turn.  Likewise, a player can only pass if they've run out of dice to play before the other player has.

Capture
-------

To capture, a player can add the values showing on the faces of two or more of their dice to equal the value on a single opponent die.  The dice used to capture are then rerolled and given to the opponent.  Likewise, the die captured is taken into the capturing player's stock and dice and also rerolled.  If you're using dice of the same color then just put the captured and capturing dice aside apart from the others.

- Blue 4 and 2 captures Red 6
- The 6 is rerolled but must eventually be placed by Blue player
- Blue 4 and 2 must be later placed by Red player

Both players are ultimately responsible for placing dice for their opponent according to the placement rules explained next.

Placing
-------

The dice that a player has in stock must all be placed on the pyramid.  When placing a die it must *always* be placed such that its face value is showing on one of the pyramid sides.  The placements continue until all of the dice have been added to the pyramid.  However, the rules for placement require that certain other edges must also show in certain multi-side placements.

### Multi-side placements

That is, if the placement of a die will show multiple faces (i.e. on a corner or the apex) then a second showing face must adhere to the following rules:

  - If the die belongs to the placing player then the second face must 
    be the smallest face on the perpendicular edge.

For example, if a player wishes to place his die showing a `6` on a corner space then that `6` must show on one side and a `1`, since it's the smallest perpendicular value, must show on the other pyramid side.

  - If it's an opponent's die that's placed then the second face must
    be the largest face on the perpendicular edge.

For example, if a player wishes to place her opponent's die showing a `2` on a corner space then that `2` must show on one side and a `6`, since it's the largest perpendicular value, must show on the other pyramid side.

The placing player can always decide which side of the pyramid the die values reside.

### The dungeon exception

There is one exception to the placement rules rule and that is if a die is placed on the center-most square, named *the dungeon*.  Naturally, the die placed in the dungeon will eventually be buried.  In this case a player will receive zero-points for this die. 

Therefore, a player can, on their first move, choose to willingly place any die on the center cell and receive the smallest value for an apex placement, 1-2-3 points for the sides showing the values on the die.  These points are added to the final score for the corresponding sides.  Should the players choose to forego placing on the center square on their first move then whomever inevitably places a die into the dungeon will receive no extra points for the final score.

### Scoring

When all of the dice have been placed onto the pyramid the players sum the points showing and any dungeon bonuses to determine the scores for each side.  The player with the highest total on the majority of sides wins the game.  If a tie occurs then the following tie-breakers take affect:

 - The player with the least captures wins
 - The player who took the dungeon wins

If neither tie-breaker applies or cancel out then both players win!

* place a die

* when you place a die you always place the face that's showing
  on the side of your choice
  - if it'll show two or three faces:
    - if it's your die then one must be the smallest 
      face on the perpendicular edge
    - if it's your opponent's die then one must be the
      largest face on the perpendicular edge

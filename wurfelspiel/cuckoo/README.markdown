*Cuckoo* (pronounced Duneshoon) is a game of pyramid construction for Two Players using a [Spiel Mini](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/110073/spiel-mini) set, designed by [Reinhold Wittig](http://www.perlhuhn.de/).

Preparation
===========

Each player gets 10 dice of differing colors, however a single color can be used if desired.  Once the dice have been allocated, each player rolls all of the dice at the same time.  The dice rolled will constitute the values available for play. This set of dice is called the *nest*.

*note: If the players use a larger  [Das Spiel](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2229/spiel) set then only the cells on a triangular region of 4x4x4 should be used.*

Goal
====

To have the most points on the majority of the three pyramid faces.

Gameplay
========

The players take alternating turns consisting of *one* of the following actions:

 * Infect a nest
 * Place a die
 * Pass
 
A player can only pass if they've run out of dice to play before the other player has.

Infecting a nest
----------------

A player can infect an opponent's nest by putting some of their own dice into it.  This is done by adding the values of two or more of their own dice to equal the value on a single opponent die.  These dice are then swapped with the opponent's single die in both player's nests.  However, before making the exchange all of the dice involved in the infection are re-rolled.  A player must use at least two dice in the exchange with their opponent.

Placing
-------

It's an important aspect of *Cuckoo* that the players are ultimately responsible for placing all of the dice in their nest onto the pyramid, including those belonging to their opponent.  When placing a die it must *always* be placed such that its upturned face is exposed on at least one side of the pyramid.  The placements continue until all of the dice have been added to the pyramid.  However, the rules for placement require that certain other edges must also show in certain multi-side placements, detailed next.

### Multi-side placements

If the placement of a die will show multiple faces (i.e. on a corner or the apex) then a second showing face must adhere to the following rules:

  - If the die belongs to the placing player then the second face must 
    be the smallest value available on the perpendicular edge.

For example, if a player wishes to place his die showing a `6` on a corner space then that `6` must show on one side and a `1`, since it's the smallest perpendicular value, must show on another pyramid side.

  - However, if it's an opponent's die that's placed then the second
    face must show the largest available value on the perpendicular
	edge.

For example, if a player wishes to place her opponent's die showing a `2` on a corner space then that `2` must show on one side and a `6`, since it's the largest perpendicular value, must show on the other pyramid side.

The placing player can always decide which side of the pyramid the die values reside.

### The dungeon

There is one exception to the placement rule and that is if a die is placed on the center-most square, named the *dungeon*.  Naturally, the die placed in the dungeon will eventually be buried.  In this case a player will receive zero-points for this die.  However, the dungeon is important should ties occur.

Scoring
-------

When all of the dice have been placed onto the pyramid the players sum the points showing and any dungeon bonuses to determine the scores for each side.  The player with the highest total on the majority of sides wins the game.  If a tie occurs then the player who took the dungeon wins.

### Continuous scoring

If you only have dice of a single color then scoring can be done as dice are placed onto the pyramid rather than at the end.  Keeping score on a piece of paper while playing and separating captured and capturing dice from the nests will help simplify this process.

Design notes
============

*Cuckoo* is clearly inspired by [Inside](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30179/inside), designed by [Henrik Morast](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/9007/henrik-morast).  It started as a direct adaptation of Inside to a Spiel Mini set, but I found that less than inspiring.  Instead, I tried to use the nature of the Spiel set's dicey nature to inform an Inside-like side-win majority theme.  I hope that I succeeded.

I grew up with my grandparents who hosted frequent game nights for Poker and Bridge.  Like most kids of my generation, I occasionally played Monopoly, Risk, Stratego, and Uno.  At one point I became obsessed with Chess for a few years, and Go for a while after that.  Despite all of this, I never really played many games.[^0]

A couple of years ago I bought [Fluxx](http://www.looneylabs.com/games/fluxx) on a whim.  I have no memory why.

I LOVED IT.

I've since picked up Chess and Go again and hope to learned Bridge to kindle some of the nostalgia of the inner kid watching the adults play.

This blog[^1] (entitled [Fogus/Spiel](http://fogus.github.io/spiel/)) is my exploration into the world of gaming and game design.  See my [welcome post](/spiel/meta/2014/08/29/welcome.html) to learn more about the goals and layout.


[^0]: Not exactly true as I played countless hours of various RPGs and LARPs as a kid/teen.

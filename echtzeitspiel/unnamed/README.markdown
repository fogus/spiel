*unnamed* is a game of blind bidding for 2-3 players.

Preparation
===========

You'll need the following materials to play *unnamed*:

 * 48 balls split into three differently colored groups of 16 (a [Shibumi set](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/135270/shibumi) works nicely)
 * 20 rings wide enough to hold the balls, called *pedestals*
 * 1 cloth bag per player
 
 For a 2-player game each player starts with 8 balls of each color.  For a 3-player game each player gets 5 balls of each color.

Goal
====

The player with the most valuable display of pedestalized balls wins the game.

Gameplay
========

The games consists of some number of turns where all players make a simultaneous bid on a pedestal and some available balls.

TODO

 * Games starts with single pedestal
 * Players hide bid and simultaneously reveal
 * Player wins pedestal
 * Highest bid goes into the next auction
 * Lowest bids go back to players
 * Repeat until all pedestals are won

Pedestalization
---------------

At any time players can put any of their balls onto the pedestals that they've won.  Only pedestalized balls will count toward the final score.  Additionally, pedestalized balls can influence the relative value of the balls used for bidding.

Values
------

Starting:

 * A pedestal beats 
 * A red ball beats
 * A white ball beats
 * A black ball

(?) Should the most pedestalized color be the highest?

*Podstavec* is a game of blind bidding for 2-3 players.

Preparation
===========

You'll need the following materials to play *Podstavec*:

 * 48 balls split into three differently colored groups of 16 (a [Shibumi set](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/135270/shibumi) works nicely)
 * 25 rings wide enough to hold the balls, called *pedestals*
 * 1 cloth bag per player
 
 For a 2-player game each player starts with 8 balls of each color.  For a 3-player game each player gets 5 balls of each color.  In both circumstances each player gets 3 pedestals to start.  The pedestals a player starts and (optionally) those won are placed in plain view in front of the players; this is called *the display*.

Goal
====

The player with the most valuable display of pedestalized balls wins the game.

Gameplay
========

The games consists of some number of turns where all players make a simultaneous bid on a pedestal and some available balls. The game starts with bidding on a single pedestal.

 * Players adjust their pedestals by placing pedestalized balls 
   into their display, swapping balls already in the display, or
   removing balls and pedestals from their display into their bags.
 * Players calculate the relative color values
 * Players hide bids in their hands and simultaneously reveal
 * Player wins pedestal and any additional balls
 * Highest bid goes into the next auction
 * Lowest bids go back to players
 * Repeat taking turns until all pedestals are won, or one 
   player holds 13
 
Once the game ends, the current displays are tallied and the player with the most valuable set wins the game.

Pedestalization
---------------

Before a bidding round begins, players can put any of their balls onto the pedestals in their inventory.  Only pedestalized balls will count toward the final score.  Additionally, pedestalized balls can influence the relative value of the balls used for bidding for a given turn, described next.

Values
------

When players place pedestalized balls into their display they can influence the relative values of the colors for a given turn.

color values:

 * A pedestal beats 
 * A red ball beats
 * A white ball beats
 * A black ball

However, after the first round the relative values may change depending on the pedestalized balls currently in play.  That is, the color on the most active pedestals for any bidding round will determine the highest valued color.  Likewise, the second-most pedestalized color will be the second most valuable color.  For ties, the relative values revert to the starting ranking.  Bear in mind that a pedestal used in a bid always beats a ball.

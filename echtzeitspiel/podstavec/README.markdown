*Podstavec* is a game of blind bidding for 2-3 players.

Preparation
===========

You'll need the following materials to play *Podstavec*:

 * 48 balls split into three differently colored groups of 16 (a [Shibumi set](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/135270/shibumi) works nicely)
 * 25 rings wide enough to hold the balls, called *pedestals*
 * 1 cloth bag per player
 
 For a 2-player game each player starts with 8 balls of each color.  For a 3-player game each player gets 5 balls of each color.  In both circumstances each player gets 3 pedestals to start.  The pedestals a player starts and (optionally) those won are placed in plain view in front of the players; this is called *the display*.

Goal
====

The player with the most valuable display of pedestalized balls wins the game.

Gameplay
========

The games consists of some number of turns where all players make a simultaneous bid on a pedestal and some available balls. The game starts with bidding on a single pedestal.

For each turn in the game, the following steps are taken:

 * Players may adjust their pedestals by placing pedestalized balls 
   into their display, swapping balls already in the display, or
   removing balls and pedestals from their display into their bags.
 * Players calculate the relative color values
 * Players hide bids in their hands and simultaneously reveal
 * Player wins pedestal and any additional balls
 * Highest bid goes into the next auction
 * Lowest bids go back to players
 


The steps above are repeated until all pedestals are won, or one player holds 13.  Once the game ends, the current displays are tallied and the player with the most valuable set wins the game.

Pedestalization
---------------

Before a bidding round begins, players can put any of their balls onto the pedestals in their inventory.  Only pedestalized balls will count toward the final score.  Additionally, pedestalized balls can influence the relative value of the balls used for bidding for a given turn, described next.

Values
------

When players place pedestalized balls into their display they can potentially influence the relative values of the colors for a given turn.  For example, if the number of total pedestalized black balls is 5, red 4, and white 2 then the relative color values are likewise black, red, then white.  However, if there are no pedestalized balls in any displays or the same amounts of each color then by default the relative values are as follows:

 * A red ball beats
 * A white ball beats
 * A black ball

On the other hand, a pedestal is used for bidding always beats a ball of any color.  However, tied pedestal bids are determined by any additional balls based on the current relative values.

*Podstavec* is a game of blind bidding for 2-3 players.

Preparation
===========

You'll need the following materials to play *Podstavec*:

 * 48 balls split into three differently colored groups of 16 (a [Shibumi set](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/135270/shibumi) works nicely)
 * 24 rings wide enough to hold the balls, called *pedestals*
 * 1 cloth bag per player
 
 For a 2-player game each player starts with 8 balls of each color.  For a 3-player game each player gets 5 balls of each color.  In both circumstances each player gets 3 pedestals to start.

Goal
====

The player with the most valuable display of pedestalized balls wins the game.

Gameplay
========

The games consists of some number of turns where all players make a simultaneous bid on a pedestal and some available balls. The game starts with bidding on a single pedestal.

 * Players adjust their pedestals (if applicable)
 * Players hide bids in their hands and simultaneously reveal
 * Player wins pedestal and any additional balls
 * Highest bid goes into the next auction
 * Lowest bids go back to players
 * Repeat until all pedestals are won, or one player wins 9

Pedestalization
---------------

Before a bidding round begins, players can put any of their balls onto the pedestals in their inventory.  Pedestalized balls can influence the relative value of the balls used for bidding.  Additionally, only pedestalized balls will count toward the final score.  

Values
------

Starting and final color values:

 * A pedestal beats 
 * A red ball beats
 * A white ball beats
 * A black ball

However, after the first round the relative values may change depending on the pedestalized balls currently in play.  That is, the color on the most active pedestals for any bidding round will determine the highest valued color.  Likewise, the second-most pedestalized color will be the second most valuable color.  For ties, the relative values revert to the starting ranking.  Bear in mind that a pedestal used in a bid always beats a ball.

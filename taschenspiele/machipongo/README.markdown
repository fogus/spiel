*Machipongo* is a simple abstract game of chance meant to be played with pocket change.

Setup
=====

The game requires 9 coins of differing sizes: 3 small, 3 medium, and 3 large. I've found that 3 quarters (USD), 3 nickels, and 3 pennies work well.  The game is played on any flat surface in a virtual or hand-drawn 3x3 grid.  The back of a napkin works well for this.

The virtual grid is situated between the players and the row nearest to each player is their "home row."

Goal
====

The goal of *Machipongo* is to achieve one of the following wining conditions:

 1. You get a symmetric arrangement of pyramids in your home 
    row, where each cell has at least one pyramid occupying it
 2. Your opponent's row contains all of the pyramids, in any
    arrangement and in any or all cells

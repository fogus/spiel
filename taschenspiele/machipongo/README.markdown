*Machipongo* is a simple abstract game of chance meant to be played with pocket change.

Setup
=====

The game requires 9 coins of differing sizes: 3 small, 3 medium, and 3 large. I've found that 3 quarters (USD), 3 nickels, and 3 pennies work well.  The game is played on any flat surface in a virtual or hand-drawn 3x3 grid.  The back of a napkin works well for this.

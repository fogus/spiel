*Machipongo* is a simple abstract game of perfect information meant to be played with pocket change.

Setup
=====

The game requires 12 coins of differing sizes: 4 small, 4 medium, and 4 large. I've found that quarters (USD), nickels, and pennies work well.  The game is played on any flat surface in a virtual or hand-drawn 3x3 grid.  The back of a napkin works well for this.

The virtual grid is situated between the players and the row nearest to each player is their "home row."  Additionally, three piles of 3 coins stacked from bottom to top, largest to smallest, in the three center cells of the grid.  The remaining three coins are placed between the players with either heads or tails all facing up.

Goal
====

The goal of *Machipongo* is to achieve one of the following wining conditions:

 1. You get a symmetric arrangement of coins in your home 
    row, where each cell has at least one coin occupying it
 2. Your opponent's row contains all of the coins, in any
    arrangement and in any or all cells

Once either of these conditions occur, the game ends.

Turns
=====

On the first turn of the game the first player can move any of the coins on the table according to the movement rules that follow. The second player, before moving, can choose to either move as below, or switch sides with the first player. This is known as the *pie rule*.

On each subsequent turn the player to move is allowed to move one or more coins into another cell of the grid, only orthogonal. The coins that are allowed to be moved are only those whose faces are the majority. In other words, if the large coin shows heads, medium tails, and small large then only the large and small coins can be moved.

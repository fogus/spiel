Palindrove is a game played in the car where players attempt to identify and score points for patterns found in nearby traffic.

Gameplay:

The game takes place over the course of a number of rounds (decided by the players beforehand).  During any given round players will alternate between serving as the spotter and score-keepers.  Each player will be the spotter for some number of minutes (decided by the players beforehand_) and when each player has served as spotter in turn the round ends.

On one hand they will tally the colors of [i]consecutive[/i] cars and on the other they will tally either the make, model, or style of car.  Additionally, as these patterns are spoken aloud they will keep track of the score on their hands.  A color palindrome of between 2-5

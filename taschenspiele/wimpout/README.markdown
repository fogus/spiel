*Cosmic Chipout* is a variant of [Cosmic Wimpout](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1302/cosmic-wimpout) designed to be played on the go.

Components
==========

 * [Cosmic Wimpout dice](http://cosmicwimpout.com/index.cfm)
 * An odd number of chips, coins, cookies, or buttons.

Goal
====

The first player to win the majority of chips wins. 

Game-play
========

*Cosmic Chipout* plays exactly like Cosmic Wimpout, save for a couple of minor tweaks to facilitate playing on the go:
  * Because you're playing for a chip at a time, the whole game is last-licks (repeat until one player cannot beat another player's current score)
  * Each won chip resets the current score
  * The player who won the last chip rolls first for the next chip
  * Repeat until a majority of chips are won

That's it --- enjoy!

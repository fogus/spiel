*unnamed* is a game of blind bidding for 2-3 players.

Preparation
===========

You'll need the following materials to play *unnamed*:

 * 48 balls split into three differently colored groups of 16 (a [Shibumi set](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/135270/shibumi) works nicely)
 * 20 rings wide enough to hold the balls
 * 1 *shield* per player
 
 For a 2-player game each player starts with 8 balls of each color.  For a 3-player game each player gets 5 balls of each color.

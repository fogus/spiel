*Minimax* is a pyramidal sowing game for 1 player.

Preparation
===========

Materials needed:

 * 1 Treehouse set for the small game or 2 sets for the long game
 * 5 playing cards (or any kind of card where one is unique)

Setup
-----

Place the cards in a wheel configuration, like in the image below:

The cards comprising the wheel should all be the same except for one, called the *vault*.  Finally, from a Treehouse set take four trios and randomly distribute the pyramids amongst all cards but the vault, three to each card.

The game is ready to begin.

Game-play
=========

*Minimax* is a Mancala game played on a circular field.  On each turn, you will take all of the pyramids on a card and sow them, one by one on each subsequent card (including the vault) in turn, in a counter-clockwise fashion, until the pyramids taken are distributed. 

The rules governing which cards you may sow from are as follows:

 * While you can sow into the vault, you may never sow from the vault.
 * On the first turn you can sow from any card that you wish.
 * If the final pyramid sown from the previous turn landed in the 
   vault then you may sow from any card that you wish.
 * If the final pyramid sown from the previous turn landed on a 
   non-empty card then you must sow from that card.

While sowing onto cards and the vault you may build stacks "in passing" if possible, but you can never rearrange existing pyramids to form stacks.  That is, while sowing pyramids you can chose to stack a sown piece onto an existing piece or stack directly, but only smaller pyramids may go onto larger pyramids.  If while doing this you ever make a tree on a non-vault card you may choose, on the next turn only, to sow the tree either as a whole or to sow it as three separate pieces.  When sown as a single piece then you must break the tree into its parts on the card that they were sown onto.

Game ends
=========

The game ends when one of the following occurs:

 * You sow the last pyramid or tree during a turn onto an empty card.
 * You successfully sow all of the pyramids into the vault.

Final scoring
=============

Only pyramids in the vault are scored, according to the following:

 * Non-trees are worth 1 point each
 * Mixed color trees are worth 4 points each
 * Mono-color trees are worth 7 points each

For the small game a perfect score is 28, while for the large game it's 56.

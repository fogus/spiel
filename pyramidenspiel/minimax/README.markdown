*Minimax* is a pyramidal sowing game for 1 player.

Preparation
===========

Materials needed:

 * 1 Treehouse set for the small game or 2 sets for the long game
 * 5 playing cards (or any kind of card where one is unique)

Setup
-----

Place the cards in a wheel configuration, like in the image below:

The cards comprising the wheel should all be the same except for one, called the *vault*.  Finally, from a Treehouse set take four trios and randomly distribute the pyramids amongst all cards but the vault, two to each card.

The game is ready to begin.

*Minimax* is a pyramidal sowing game for 1 player.

Preparation
===========

Materials needed:

 * 1 Treehouse set for the small game or 2 sets for the long game
 * 5 playing cards (or any kind of card where one is unique)

Setup
-----

Place the cards in a wheel configuration, like in the image below:

The cards comprising the wheel should all be the same except for one, called the *vault*.  Finally, from a Treehouse set take four trios and randomly distribute the pyramids amongst all cards but the vault, two to each card.

The game is ready to begin.

Game-play
=========

*Minimax* is a Mancala game played on a circular field.  On each turn, you will take all of the pyramids on a card and sows them, one by one on each subsequent card (including the vault) in turn, in a counter-clockwise fashion, until the pyramids taken are distributed. 

The rules governing which cards you take pyramids for sowing are as follows:

 * While you can sow into the vault, you may never sow from the vault.
 * On the first turn you can sow from any card that you wish.
 * If the final pyramid sown from the previous turn landed in the 
   vault then you may sow from any card that you wish.
 * If the final pyramid sown from the previous turn landed on a 
   non-empty card then you must sow from that card.

Game ends
=========

The game ends when one of the following occurs:

 * You sow the last pyramid in a turn onto an empty card.
 * You successfully sow all of the pyramids into the vault.

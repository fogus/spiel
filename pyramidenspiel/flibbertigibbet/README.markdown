*Flibbertigibbet* is a simple abstract game of perfect information involving pyramid movement determined by a 6-sided die, but not in the way you might think.

Setup
=====

To play you'll need a 3x4 board, a 6-sided die, and 9 pyramids of any color, 3 each of small medium and large sizes.  You should setup the board in the following configuration:

![todo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fogus/spiel/master/graphics/original/todo.jpg)

One player is assigned a row of three cells to be their "home row" while the other player gets the row on the opposite end. Now, place the die between the two players with the 1 facing up.  Once setup, the game can begin.

Goal
====

There are two ways to win:

 1. You get a symmetric arrangement of pyramids in your home 
    row, where each cell has at least one pyramid occupying it
 2. Your opponent's row contains all of the pyramids, in any
    arrangement and in any or all cells

In either case, the arrangement of pieces must arise as the result of using all of your allocated movement points, described next.

Turns
=====

On each turn the player to move is allocated a certain number of movement points as currently shown on the top of the die.  The first player of the game will always get 1-point of movement. Movement points are spent by moving pyramids and all points must be spent on each turn.

Pyramids cost the following to move 1-square orthogonally from where they sit:

 1. Small pyramid
 2. Medium pyramid
 3. Large pyramid

Movement points can be spent to move a single pyramid multiple times or multiple pyramids in turn.  There are constraints about how pyramids may be moved however:

 * No pyramid can land, even in passing, on a smaller pyramid
 * Landing on an empty square during movement freezes a pyramid 
   from moving anymore during that turn
 * A pyramid resting on an empty square can be move out of it, 
   but it is frozen for the rest of that turn
 * A pile of pyramids can move 

Once movement points are spent, no more pyramids can be moved during that player's turn.  When a player can

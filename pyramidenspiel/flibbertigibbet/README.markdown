*Flibbertigibbet* is a simple abstract game of pyramid movement that is determined by a 6-sided die, but not in the way you might think.

Setup
=====

To play you'll need a 3x4 board, a 6-sided die, and 9 pyramids of any color, 3 each of small medium and large sizes.  You should setup the board in the following configuration:

One player is assigned a row of three cells to be their "home row" while the other player gets the row on the opposite end. Now, place the die between the two players with the 1 facing up.  Once setup, the game can begin.

Goal
====

There are two ways to win:

 1. You get a symmetric arrangement of pyramids in your home row
 2. Your opponent's row contains all of the pyramids, in any arrangement

In either case, the arrangement of pieces must arise as the result of using all of your allocated movement points, described next.

Turns

*unnamed* is a tile-laying, area-control game using [IOTA](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/119632/iota) cards for 2 players.

 1. Deal three cards, each player gets 1 wild card
 2. Seed one card on the table
 
 
 ## on a turn do one of the following
 - place card ortho that match 2-features (with small)
 - place card diag that match only one feature (with small)
 - grow a pyramid
 - destroy an unoccupied card using a wild card
 
 Done when player runs out of cards
 
Score the number of cards in groups of at least 2, occupied by the player with the most powerful presence.

?Should I resolve the conflicts? Remaining pieces determine presence?

*Egyptian Whist* is a pyramidal drafting and point-trick-taking game of perfect information for 2 players.

Preparation
===========

Materials needed:

 * 4 Treehouse sets for the normal game or 2 sets for the short game

Setup
-----

Place all of the Treehouse sets into an opaque sack.  Draw from the sack one small, one medium, and one large and make a tree.  Continue this until all of the pyramids have been used to make a row of complete trees.  The game is ready to begin.

Game-play
=========

*Egyptian Whist* is played in two rounds: the first is meant to build a mixed stash of pyramids via drafting, and the second consists of a series of tricks used to build a set of final pyramids for scoring.

Stage one: drafting a stash
---------------------------

The player who drafts first will take any of the small pyramids from the top of the trees for use in their personal stash.  If desired, the second player may choose to take the small pyramid drafted by the first player instead of drafting second.

After the draft order has been established, both players will continue alternating drafting pieces from the tops of the trees remaining.  In other words, pyramids may only be taken from the drafting trees if they do not have pyramids resting on top of them.

Additionally, players may not take any pyramids that would give them too many of a particular size to be unable to build a complete set of trees in their personal stash.  That is, with four Treehouse sets each player would have 10 complete trees consisting only of 10 smalls, 10 mediums, and 10 larges.

The drafting stage one continue this way until all of the pyramids in the drafting trees are gone.

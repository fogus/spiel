*Egyptian Whist* is a pyramidal drafting and point-trick-taking game of perfect information for 2 players.

Preparation
===========

Materials needed:

 * 4 Treehouse sets for the normal game or 2 sets for the short game

Setup
-----

Place all of the Treehouse sets into an opaque sack.  Draw from the sack one small, one medium, and one large and make a tree.  Continue this until all of the pyramids have been used to make a row of complete trees.  The game is ready to begin after the players agree whom should draft first.

Game-play
=========

*Egyptian Whist* is played in two rounds: the first is meant to build a mixed stash of pyramids via drafting, and the second consists of a series of tricks used to build a set of final pyramids for scoring.

Pyrametto is a push-your-luck dice game which is a variant of [Coloretto](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/5782/coloretto) adapted for Looney Pyramids.  Pyrametto adopts the scoring of [Volcano](http://www.wunderland.com/WTS/Kristin/Games/Volcano.html) (both by [Looney Labs](http://www.looneylabs.com)), with the push-your-luck mechanics of Coloretto mixed with the take-that aspect of [IceDice](http://www.looneylabs.com/games/icedice).

Setup of Pyrametto
==================

Pyrametto requires three [Treehouse sets](http://www.looneylabs.com/rules/treehouse) for a 2-3 player game and an additional set for every player thereafter, up to 5.  The game also requires a set of IceDice dice, one pyramid die and a color die.

To setup the game simple create stacks of the available pyramids in the middle of the table, grouped by color and size.  This setup of pyramids is called the *global inventory*.

During the course of a game with 3-5 players, they will be building stacks of pyramids a maximum of 3-high, equal to the number of players.  For a 2-player game there will be only 3-stacks, one 1-pyramid high, another 2-pyramids high, and the last 3-pyramids high.  Players will building their personal *vault* of pyramids from the stacks in play, for the purpose of final scoring.

Turns in Pyrametto
==================

On each turn a player can either take an existing stack of pyramids or roll the dice and add what's shown to an existing stack.  A stack of pyramids available for taking can never contain more than 3 pyramids.  Once a stack is full a rolled piece must be be placed on another stack that contains 2 or fewer pyramids.  If all of the stacks become full then the players must chose a stack in turn order.

### Rolling a color/size that's not in the global inventory

If you happen to roll a color/size combination that's missing from the global inventory then you must take that size from one of the players (including themselves if required) to place in one of the stacks.  The stolen pyramid can be claimed by any of the players just like as if it had been taken from the global inventory.

### Running out of a color

In a 3-5 player game the last round is signalled when all of the pyramids of a certain color run out.  The remaining players may finish their turns when this condition occurs before scoring commences.

### Ending the game

Once everyone takes their final turn the game ends. You may now  calculate the scores.

Scoring in Pyrametto
====================

When the game ends look at the pyramids in your Vault and score according to the following:

* 7 points for each solid-color tree
* 5 points for each mixed-color tree
* 1 point for each of the rest of your pieces

To start scoring, just add up all of the scores of the pyramids according to the groupings listed above.

> For example, a Vault with 2 red trees would initially score 
> (7 + 7) = 14 points

For every duplicate solid-color tree, double the score of your Vault.

> For example, a Vault with 2 red trees would further score 
> (7 + 7) * 2 = 28 points

Finally, take the score of your Vault and multiply it by the last successful turn number (i.e. the value of the pips on the Turn Markers minus 1) to get your final score.

> For example, a Vault with 2 red trees, ending on turn 7 would score
> ((7 + 7) * 2) * 6 = 168 total points

Once done, play again to try and beat your high score!

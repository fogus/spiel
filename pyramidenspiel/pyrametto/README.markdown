Pyrametto is a push-your-luck dice game which is a variant of [Coloretto](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/5782/coloretto) adapted for Looney Pyramids.  Pyrametto adopts the scoring of [Volcano](http://www.wunderland.com/WTS/Kristin/Games/Volcano.html) (both by [Looney Labs](http://www.looneylabs.com)), with the push-your-luck mechanics of Coloretto mixed with the take-that aspect of [IceDice](http://www.looneylabs.com/games/icedice).

Setup of Pyrametto
==================

Pyrametto requires three [Treehouse sets](http://www.looneylabs.com/rules/treehouse) for a 3-player game and an additional set for every player thereafter, up to 5.  The game also requires a set of IceDice dice: one pyramid die and a color die.

To setup the game simply create stacks of the available pyramids in the middle of the table, grouped by color and size.  This setup of pyramids is called the *global inventory*.

During the course of a game with 3-5, players will be building stacks of pyramids a maximum of 3-high, equal to the number of players.  Players will building their personal *vault* of pyramids from the stacks in play, for the purpose of final scoring.

Turns in Pyrametto
==================

On each turn a player can either take an existing stack of pyramids or roll the dice and add what's shown to an existing stack.  A stack of pyramids available for taking can never contain more than 3 pyramids.  Once a stack is full a rolled piece must be be placed on another stack that contains 2 or fewer pyramids.  If all of the stacks become full then the players must chose a stack in turn order.

### Rolling a color/size that's not in the global inventory

If a player happens to roll a color/size combination that's missing from the global inventory then that player must take that size from one of the players (including themselves if required) to place on one of the stacks.  The stolen pyramid can be claimed by any of the players just like as if it had been taken from the global inventory.

### Running out of a color

In a 3-5 player game the last round is signaled when all of the pyramids of any two sizes of any one color runs out. The remaining players may finish their turns when this condition occurs before scoring commences. 

For example, in a 4-player game the 1st player takes a stack to end their turn in the round.  Next, the 2nd player rolls and places the last small yellow.  Then, the 3rd player rolls and places the last medium yellow thus signalling the last round.  The 4th player may then chose to roll and place or to take a stack, but for this explanation assume that they chose to take a stack.  The 2nd player must then take another stack followed by the 3rd player who must take the last stack which ends that game.  The players then calculate their scores.

Scoring in Pyrametto
====================

When the game ends look at the pyramids in your Vault and score according to the following:

* 7 points the first solid-color tree
* 11 points for the second solid-color tree
* -3 points for the fourth solid-color tree
* -5 points for the fifth solid-color tree
* -7 points for the sixth solid-color tree
* 5 points for the first mixed-color tree
* 7 points for the second mixed-color tree
* -1 point for the third mixed-color tree
* -3 point for the forth mixed-color tree
* -5 point for the fifth mixed-color tree
* -1 point for each of the remaining pieces unable to form trees

To start scoring, just add up all of the scores of the pyramids according to the groupings listed above.

> For example, a Vault with 2 red trees would initially score 
> (7 + 11) = 18 points

However, a third red tree would adjust the score as follows:

> (7 + 11) - 3 = 15 points

Further, if the player had enough pieces to form a mixed tree, then the score would again be adjusted:

> (7 + 11) - 3 + 5 = 20 points

Finally, if the player had a single pyramid remaining pyramid then the score would be finalized as:

> (7 + 11) - 3 + 5 - 1 = 19 points

Once done, set it all up and play again!

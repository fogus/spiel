Pyrametto is a push-your-luck dice game which is a variant of [Coloretto](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/5782/coloretto) adapted for Looney Pyramids.  Pyrametto adopts the scoring of [Volcano](http://www.wunderland.com/WTS/Kristin/Games/Volcano.html) (both by [Looney Labs](http://www.looneylabs.com)), with the push-your-luck mechanics of Coloretto. 

Setup of Pyrametto
==================

Pyrametto requires three [Treehouse sets](http://www.looneylabs.com/rules/treehouse) for a 2-3 player game and an additional set for every player thereafter, up to 5.

Turns in Pyrametto
==================

TODO

 * 3 lanes
 * pew pew die and icehouse die
 * running out of a size/color signals final round
 
### Ending the game

Once everyone takes their final turn the game ends. You may now  calculate the scores.

Scoring in Pyrametto
====================

When the game ends look at the pyramids in your Vault and score according to the following:

* 7 points for each solid-color tree
* 5 points for each mixed-color tree
* 1 point for each of the rest of your pieces

To start scoring, just add up all of the scores of the pyramids according to the groupings listed above.

> For example, a Vault with 2 red trees would initially score 
> (7 + 7) = 14 points

For every duplicate solid-color tree, double the score of your Vault.

> For example, a Vault with 2 red trees would further score 
> (7 + 7) * 2 = 28 points

Finally, take the score of your Vault and multiply it by the last successful turn number (i.e. the value of the pips on the Turn Markers minus 1) to get your final score.

> For example, a Vault with 2 red trees, ending on turn 7 would score
> ((7 + 7) * 2) * 6 = 168 total points

Once done, play again to try and beat your high score!

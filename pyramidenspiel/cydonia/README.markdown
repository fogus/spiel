*Cydonia* is a pyramidal point-trick-taking game of perfect information for 2 players.

Preparation
-----------

Materials needed:

 * 6 Treehouse sets
 
Place two Treehouse sets into a sack and distribute two Treehouse sets to each player.  Draw from the sack one small, one medium, and one large and make a tree.  Continue this until all of the pyramids have been used to make a line of 20 trees.

The game is ready to begin after the players agree whom should lead first.

Gameplay
--------

*Cydonia* is played in two rounds: the first is meant to build a mixed stash of pyramids, and the second consists of a series of 10 tricks  to build a set of final pyramids used for scoring.

### Stage one: building a mixed stash

Starting with the first tree, the lead player builds a pyramid from her current stash of pyramids and places it near the line of trees.  The other player follows with a tree of his own.

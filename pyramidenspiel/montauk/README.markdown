*Montauk* is a pyramidal racing game for 2 players.

Preparation
===========

Materials needed:

 * 1 Treehouse set
 * A deck of playing cards
 * 1 pyramid die
 * Some paper and a pen

On the sheets of paper, draw a playing surface for each player in the following configuration:

From a treehouse set, give each player all of the pyramids of two colors (i.e. two trios each).  The black pyramids are kept off to the side and are used as *null* markers.

Setup
-----

First, shuffle all of the cards thouroughly and place them to the side.  Next, each player takes a single pyramid and rolls a die for it.  Depending on the number rolled, the pyramid is placed onto the same numbered spot of the play area.  All of the other pyramids are placed in the same way so that the player boards look like the following:

The game is ready to begin.

Game-play
=========

Montauk is played with a standard 52-card deck where Ace to 6 and 7 to Queen are worth 1 to 6 points respectively.  The kings on the other hand are worth 0 points.

The points of the cards are used to move the pyramids on the player board from the higher numbered boxes off the board.  For example, a pyramid on the 3 spot requires a 3 (or 9) and higher to remove it from the board.  However, to move a pyramid from the 6 spot to the 4 spot requires exactly a 2 (or 8).  This is similar to the way that "bearing off" works in Backgammon, but with card play instead.

The Deal
--------

The game is played over the course of 12 rounds.  At the start of each round six cards are dealt to each player.  The player with the fewest points overall goes first, otherwise the player with the longest hair does.

Placing
-------

The leading player chooses a card from their hand and places it *face down* in front of theor play area.  Once a card is laid it may not be taken back.  The following player then chooses a card from their hand and places it *face up* in front of their play area.  The leading player then turns their card over and the result of the trick is determined.

Tricks
------

When the cards are turned over, the suits are used to determine the player who won the trick.  The suits are ranked according to the typical Bridge rankings except that clubs always beat spades, as shown below:

Design notes
============

Montauk is an adaptation of the wonderful game Marrakesh by Prince Joli Quentin Kansil to the Icehouse game system.

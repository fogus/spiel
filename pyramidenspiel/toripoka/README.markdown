The *Toripoka* deck
=====================

As mentioned, the *Toripoka* deck contains only 17 cards consisting of 13 standard playing cards (of the hearts suit) and 4 wild cards (4, 7, 10, and King of spades).  The suit of the wild cards is unimportant and as a result the cards should be considered a single suit.  Therefore, the dynamics of building Poker-like hands is simpler and less rich in possibilities by design.

Wild cards
----------

Although the spades suit is used for the wild cards, the suit does not matter in the least.  Instead, the rank of the card is the important feature of the wild cards.  That is, the rank of the wild cards describe how they're constrained in standing in for any given card in a hand.

Normally, wild cards can stand in for any card in a hand, but in *Toripoka* the ranks determine the range of cards that a wild card can stand in for.  That is, the rank of a wild card says that it can stand in for any other card of that rank or lower.  For example, the 4-wild can only stand in for the 4, 3, 2, and low-Ace, but the King-wild can stand in for every card except the high-Ace.

The Ace
-------

The Aces in *Toripoka* can be used in a hand as either a low-card (a 1) or a high-card, but not both at the same time.  The Ace as a high card can never be substitued for using a wild card.  However, with the use of a wild card and an Ace a hand could be considered having both a low and a high Ace.  

Ranking of possible hands
-------------------------

 * Royal flush (without wild)
 * Royal flush (with wild)
 * Five of a kind
 * Four of a kind
 * Three of a kind
 * Straight 
 * Two of a kind
 * A sum
 * High card

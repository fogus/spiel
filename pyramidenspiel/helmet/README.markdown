*Helmet* is a press-your-luck dice game of philosophical debating for 2 players.

Preparation
-----------

You'll need the following materials to play *Helmet*:

 * 5 pyramid dice, or 5 six-sided dice
 * 3 [rainbow pyramid sets](http://www.looneylabs.com/looney-pyramids)
 * 10 playing cards or index cards

Core arguments
--------------

In any good philosophical debate there are three critical topics of discussion:
 * The problem of knowledge
 * The problem of conduct
 * The problem of governance

In *Helmet* it is your task to participate in a philosophical debate that covers, preferably in equal parts, these three core topics.  These topics are abstractly represented as symbols on a special pyramid die, or as the first three numbers on a regular die: 

 Topic | Pyramid | Die
 :---: | :---: | :---:
 Knowledge | ![knowledge](http://images.fogus.me/games/pyramid-games/images/pd-puppy.png) | ![knowledge6](http://raw.githubusercontent.com/fogus/spiel/master/pyramidenspiel/helmet/graphics/die1.png)
 Conduct | ![conduct](http://images.fogus.me/games/pyramid-games/images/pd-philosopher.png) | ![conduct6](http://raw.githubusercontent.com/fogus/spiel/master/pyramidenspiel/helmet/graphics/die2.png)
 Governance | ![govern](http://images.fogus.me/games/pyramid-games/images/pd-brute.png) | ![govern6](http://raw.githubusercontent.com/fogus/spiel/master/pyramidenspiel/helmet/graphics/die3.png)

Any constructed argument *must* have at least one each of the three core argument topics.  However, there are other ways to cover these topics without focusing solely on them by the way of *nuanced arguments*.

Nuanced arguments 
-----------------

Nuanced arguments feature combined aspects of the core arguments and are represented as faces on a pyramid or regular die:

 Pyramid | Die

Preparing a statement and retort
--------------------------------

 * must have at least one of each core argument
 * roll up to 3 times
 * reroll as many as you want each time
 * take whichever colors you desire in alternating fashion
   - lowest value goes first

Debating
--------

 * secretly align the arguments in your statement and retort
 * reveal
 * calculate argument resolution
 * set aside pyramids of won colors

Scoring
-------

 * Volcano? Other? (most balanced -- undercut?)

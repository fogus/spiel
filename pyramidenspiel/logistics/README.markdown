*Logistics* is a game of pyramid transportation and capture using a  movement and capture mechanism inspired by Mancala for 2 players.

Preparation
===========

You'll need the following materials to play *Logistics*:

 * 8-10 playing cards (suit doesn't matter) or index cards.
 * 1 [IceDice set](http://www.looneylabs.com/games/icedice) per player (i.e. 4 [Treehouse sets](http://www.looneylabs.com/games/treehouse) total)
 
For a short game, the cards should be layed out in a 2x3 grid with an card to each player's right turned to the side; this is known as the *Vault*.  For the longer game the cards should be in a 2x4 grid, also with a turned card to the right serving as the Vault.  The layout for the long game is as follows:

You may also use larger layouts for even larger games.  Indeed, you can build a grid of up to 2x10, but you need an extra Treehouse set per player to facilitate a game of this size.

Goal
====

The player with the most valuable set of captured and transported pyramids wins the game.  See the *scoring* section below to learn how to calculate the final score.

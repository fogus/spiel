*Initiative* is a drafting and fencing game where one player attempts to
play a pyramid that his or her opponent cannot parry.

Gameplay
--------

*Initiative* is played on any flat surface where each player places
their pyramids in a row, across from the other player's pieces, until
one player is unable to play or both players run out of pyramids. The
precise rules of play are described below.

### Quick setup

Before beginning, take 5 pyramids, one of each color all the same size, from the set of available pyramids and pile them one on top of each other in any order and set aside. This structure is called the **initiative stack**.  The initiative stack describes the precedence of the colors.  The color higher on the stack trumps a color lower on the stack, this precedence will determine which player gets to lead on a turn; that is, who has the initiative.

To get started with *Initiative* just randomly mix the remaining 25 pyramids into a container. Once mixed, one player can roll the pyramid die 10 times, each time blindly taking a pyramid from the bag corresponding to their choice of size (as indicated by the die face). Once 10 pyramids are taken the other player takes 10 of those remaining. The image below shows the typical layout of the playing area for two “fictional” players, Alison and Kristin.

The player who has experience in fencing goes first, otherwise a quick
game of *Rock, Paper, Scissors* or [Pew Pew, Die][] can determine who
goes first.

*This is a good way to get started quickly to explore the mechanics of
fencing and initiative, but a drafting system is described later that
provides more control over each player's pyramids.*

### Placing pieces and parrying

A round of *Initiative* consists of a number of turns (10 maximum) each
consisting of an attack by one player and a defense by the other. For
each attack, the defending player must play a piece in response
according to the following guidelines:

-   If you have a piece of the same size, then it must be played. You
    are not forced to play the same color if you have more than one
    piece of the attacking size.
-   If you do not have a piece of the same size, then you must play a
    piece of the same color

#### Results of each piece placement

Depending on the results of the defense as defined above, one of three
things could occur:

-   The defending player gains the initiative for the attack on the next
    turn
-   The defending player successfully defends, but does not gain the
    initiative for attack
-   The defending player does not have a defending piece, and losses the
    round

#### Gaining initiative

Gaining initiative happens in one of two ways:

-   The defender plays a piece of the same size, but with a color higher
    on the initiative stack
-   The defending player plays a piece of the same color, but of a
    larger size

### An example round using the basic rules

The following image shows the result of a game played using the inventories shown earlier for Kristin and Alison.  This is just one possible scenario for illustration and not meant to show optimal play by either player.  The black and white stones shown are not needed for your own game and are shown only to mark the starting pyramid (white) and the changes in ininitiative (black).

![basic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fogus/spiel/master/pyramidenspiel/initiative/graphics/basic-play-final.png)

 1. Alison begins the round by placing a small blue. Kristin does not 
    have a small, so she must follow with a different blue pyramid. 
	She therefore responds by placing a medium blue, gaining initiative
 2. Kristen then lays a large green and Alison responds in turn with a 
    large blue, gaining initiative
 3. Alison then places a medium yellow and Kristin responds with a 
    medium green, gaining initiative
 4. Kristin then places a large yellow and Alison responds with a 
    large red
 5. Kristen, having kept initiative places a large green. Alison responds
    with her last large pyramid, a red.
 6. Kristen places a large black and Alison responds with a medium black
 7. Kristin then places a large yellow and Alison responds with a 
    medium yellow
 8. Finally, Kristin places a large black and because Alison has no
    more large pyramids nor smaller black pieces, she has lost.

The sample round thus concludes with Kristin scoring 24 points, but how was it calculated?  The basic scoring for Initiative are as follows.

### Simple Scoring

Scoring a round in Initiative is fairly simple. The formula is as
follows:

    Number of pyramids in the winner's row
                     X
     The pip count of the winning pyramid
    ---------------------------------------
          Total score for the round

Therefore, Kristin won the round with 24 points because she had 8 pyramids in her play area and won the round with a large pyramid, worth 3 points.

Examples:

-   Kristin wins on her 7th pyramid, which is a medium, meaning her score
    for the round is 14 points
-   Alison wins on her 1st pyramid with a large, meaning her score for
    the round is 3 points

There are additional scoring possibilities in the advanced rules section
below.


#### Then swap pyramids

The rules above are for the basic attack and defense rules. As an
additional test of skill, the players can swap their set of pyramids and
lead with the same set as the previous round to see who gets the higher
score.  The player with the highest overall score is the winner of the 
2-round match.


Advanced play
-------------

While Initiative using the basic rules is fairly interesting, the depth of play is somewhat shallow.  Therefore, you should consider playing with the following additional rules to add depth an variability to the game once you feel comfortable with the basic gameplay rules.

### Sacrificing and manipulating the initiative stack

As you saw in the playthrough above, it was clear that Alison was going to lose before the end, yet she was forced to play out the remaining few pyramids. If the initiative stack had been organized slightly differently then Alison might have had a chance to win, or at least to maintain or gain initiative more often.

Through a technique called "sacrificing" a player can indeed manipulate the initiative stack and move colors up and down the stack from 1 to 3 slots at a time.  To sacrifice a piece, a player only needs to place it under the pyramid that they wish to play on their turn.  That is, the player plays two pyramids on a turn, the one on the top being the placed piece and the one on the bottom being the sacrificed piece.  The size of the sacrificed piece then gives them 1 to 3 points (small = 1, medium = 2, large = 3) for use in making piece swaps on the initiative stack.  

A piece swap on the initiative stack means that the color of the played piece can be moved up or down the initiative stack the number of slots indicated by the size of the sacrificed piece.  This allows the player to redefine the color precedence and (potentially) make their placed color higher on the stack for the purpose of retaining initiative.  But beware, either the leader or the responder can sacrifice on any play, so the initiative stack might change a few times during a round.

**TODO: add an example**

 1. Alison leads the round by playing a medium blue, and Kristin
    follows with a medium green
 2. Alison then places a large blue, and Kristin follows with a 
    large green
 3. Alison then places a medium yellow while sacrificing a medium
    black. The yellow color on the initiative stack is moved up
	two slots on top of green and under blue. Kristin then places
	a medium blue, gaining initiative
 4. Kristin then places a medium black, and Alison follows with a 
    medium red while sacrificing a large red.  The red color on the 
	initiative stack is moved upwards 3 slots on top of the yellow
	and under the blue.  The new initiative stack precedence rules
	that red is now higher than black, therefore Alison has gained 
	the initiative for the next turn
 5. 

By sacrificing pieces a player can gain or retain initiative from one play to another.  Also, sacrificing allows players to get more pyramids into the play area for the purposes of increasing their round score.  It's a powerful technique, that adds much more depth to the play of any given round.  Failing to sacrifice at a crucial moment could spell disaster for a player.

### Calling a color

During a turn a player may lead with a small pyramid and force the play of its color.  This action is signified by laying the pyramid flat on its side facing your opponent with its sacrificed piece (if any) also laying, but inside the small.  The defending player **must** play a pyramid of that color on their defensive placement and cannot sacrifice that color only on that turn, but they can still sacrifice any other color that they wish.

Every sacrifice made in a round (by both players) causes the total score to be doubled.  For example, if both players sacrifice once each then the final score for the winning player is doubled and then doubled again.

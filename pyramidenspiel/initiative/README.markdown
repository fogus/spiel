*Initiative* is a drafting and fencing game where one player attempts to
play a pyramid that his or her opponent cannot parry.

Gameplay
--------

*Initiative* is played on any flat surface where each player places
their pyramids in a row, across from the other player's pieces, until
one player is unable to play or both players run out of pyramids. The
precise rules of play are described below.

### Quick setup

Before beginning, take 5 pyramids, one of each color all the same size,
from the set of available pyramids and pile them one on top of each
other in any order and set aside. This structure is called the
**initiative stack**.

To get started with *Initiative* you can forego the drafting stage and
just randomly mix the remaining 25 pyramids into a container. Once
mixed, one player can roll the pyramid die 10 times, each time blindly
taking a pyramid from the bag corresponding to their choice of size (as
indicated by the die face). Once 10 pyramids are taken the other player
takes 10 of those remaining. The image below shows the typical layout of
the playing area for two “fictional” players, Alison and Andy.

The player who has experience in fencing goes first, otherwise a quick
game of *Rock, Paper, Scissors* or [Pew Pew, Die][] can determine who
goes first.

*This is a good way to get started quickly to explore the mechanics of
fencing and initiative, but a drafting system is described later that
provides more control over each player's pyramids.*

*Initiative* is a drafting and fencing game where one player attempts to
play a pyramid that his or her opponent cannot parry.

Gameplay
--------

*Initiative* is played on any flat surface where each player places
their pyramids in a row, across from the other player's pieces, until
one player is unable to play or both players run out of pyramids. The
precise rules of play are described below.

### Quick setup

Before beginning, take 5 pyramids, one of each color all the same size,
from the set of available pyramids and pile them one on top of each
other in any order and set aside. This structure is called the
**initiative stack**.

To get started with *Initiative* you can forego the drafting stage and
just randomly mix the remaining 25 pyramids into a container. Once
mixed, one player can roll the pyramid die 10 times, each time blindly
taking a pyramid from the bag corresponding to their choice of size (as
indicated by the die face). Once 10 pyramids are taken the other player
takes 10 of those remaining. The image below shows the typical layout of
the playing area for two “fictional” players, Alison and Kristin.

The player who has experience in fencing goes first, otherwise a quick
game of *Rock, Paper, Scissors* or [Pew Pew, Die][] can determine who
goes first.

*This is a good way to get started quickly to explore the mechanics of
fencing and initiative, but a drafting system is described later that
provides more control over each player's pyramids.*

### Placing pieces and parrying

A round of *Initiative* consists of a number of turns (10 maximum) each
consisting of an attack by one player and a defense by the other. For
each attack, the defending player must play a piece in response
according to the following guidelines:

-   If you have a piece of the same size, then it must be played. You
    are not forced to play the same color if you have more than one
    piece of the attacking size.
-   If you do not have a piece of the same size, then you must play a
    piece of the same color

#### Results of each piece placement

Depending on the results of the defense as defined above, one of three
things could occur:

-   The defending player gains the initiative for the attack on the next
    turn
-   The defending player successfully defends, but does not gain the
    initiative for attack
-   The defending player does not have a defending piece, and losses the
    round

#### Gaining initiative

Gaining initiative happens in one of two ways:

-   The defender plays a piece of the same size, but with a color higher
    on the initiative stack
-   The defending player plays a piece of the same color, but of a
    larger size

### An example round using the basic rules

#### Then swap pyramids

The rules above are for the basic attack and defense rules. As an
additional test of skill, the players can swap their set of pyramids and
lead with the same set as the previous round to see who gets the higher
score.

You'll find the rules for more advanced attack and defense maneuvers
later on this page, but for now observe the following play through based
on these basic rules.

### Simple Scoring

Scoring a round in Initiative is fairly simple. The formula is as
follows:

    Number of pyramids in the winner's row
                     X
     The pip count of the winning pyramid
    ---------------------------------------
          Total score for the round

Examples:

-   Kristin wins on her 7th pyramid, which is a medium, meaning her score
    for the round is 14 points
-   Alison wins on her 1st pyramid with a large, meaning her score for
    the round is 3 points

There are additional scoring possibilities in the advanced rules section
below.

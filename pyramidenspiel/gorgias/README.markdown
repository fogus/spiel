*Gorgias* is a press-your-luck dice game of philosophical debating for 2 players.

Preparation
-----------

You'll need the following materials to play *Gorgias*:

 * 5 pyramid dice, or 5 six-sided dice
 * 3 [rainbow pyramid sets](http://www.looneylabs.com/looney-pyramids)
 * 10 playing cards or index cards

Core arguments
--------------

In any good philosophical debate there are three critical topics of discussion:

 * The problem of knowledge
 * The problem of conduct
 * The problem of governance

In *Gorgias* it is your task to participate in a philosophical debate that covers, preferably in equal parts, these three core topics.  These topics are abstractly represented as symbols on a special pyramid die, or as the first three numbers on a regular die: 

 Topic | Pyramid | Die
 :---: | :---: | :---:
 Knowledge | ![knowledge](http://images.fogus.me/games/pyramid-games/images/pd-puppy.png) | ![knowledge6](http://raw.githubusercontent.com/fogus/spiel/master/pyramidenspiel/helmet/graphics/die1.png)
 Conduct | ![conduct](http://images.fogus.me/games/pyramid-games/images/pd-philosopher.png) | ![conduct6](http://raw.githubusercontent.com/fogus/spiel/master/pyramidenspiel/helmet/graphics/die2.png)
 Governance | ![govern](http://images.fogus.me/games/pyramid-games/images/pd-brute.png) | ![govern6](http://raw.githubusercontent.com/fogus/spiel/master/pyramidenspiel/helmet/graphics/die3.png)

Any constructed argument *must* have at least one each of the three core argument topics.  However, there are other ways to cover these topics without focusing solely on them by the way of *nuanced arguments*.

Nuanced arguments 
-----------------

Nuanced arguments feature combined aspects of the core arguments and are represented as faces on a pyramid or regular die:

 Pyramid | Die
 :---: | :---:
 ![d12](http://images.fogus.me/games/pyramid-games/images/pd-minotaur.png) | ![d4](http://raw.githubusercontent.com/fogus/spiel/master/pyramidenspiel/helmet/graphics/die4.png)
 ![d31](http://images.fogus.me/games/pyramid-games/images/pd-catoblepas.png) | ![d5](http://raw.githubusercontent.com/fogus/spiel/master/pyramidenspiel/helmet/graphics/die5.png)
 ![d32](http://images.fogus.me/games/pyramid-games/images/pd-juggernaut.png) | ![govern6](http://raw.githubusercontent.com/fogus/spiel/master/pyramidenspiel/helmet/graphics/die6.png)


Nuanced arguments are a good way to ensure a powerful case and meet the demands of the three core arguments.

Gameplay
--------

A game of *Gorgias* consists of eight rounds, or *statements*, that consist of five groups of pyramids representing the results of rolling the arguments dice.  These groups are secretly arranged behind a shield across from the opponent's groups.  Once both players' groups are revealed the results are calculated and won pyramids dispersed.

Preparing statements
---------------------

Statements are built by rolling the arguments dice up to three times and keeping any number of dice aside during each roll to formulate the set.  However, the lone caveat in building a set is that each of the three core arguments must be represented either as their exact faces or within nuanced arguments.  Whenever a set is  rolled without represention in all three core arguments then a set of the arguing player's choice will be removed from play for that round.  Finally, once a set is formed via the pyramid dice rolls then the players take alternating turns pulling pyramids from a their personal stock of any color of the size needed to fulfill the dictates of the faces of the dice.

 * take whichever colors you desire in alternating fashion
   - lowest value goes first

Debating
--------

 * secretly align the arguments in your statement and retort
 * reveal
 * calculate argument resolution
 * set aside pyramids of won colors

Scoring
-------

 * Volcano? Other? (most balanced -- undercut?)

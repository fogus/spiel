*Gorgias* is a press-your-luck dice game of philosophical debating for 2 players.

Preparation
-----------

You'll need the following materials to play *Gorgias*:

 * 5 pyramid dice, or 5 six-sided dice
 * 3 [rainbow pyramid sets](http://www.looneylabs.com/looney-pyramids)
 * 10 playing cards or index cards

Core arguments
--------------

In any good philosophical debate there are three critical topics of discussion:

 * The problem of knowledge
 * The problem of conduct
 * The problem of governance

In *Gorgias* it is your task to participate in a philosophical debate that covers, preferably in equal parts, these three core topics.  These topics are abstractly represented as symbols on a special pyramid die, or as the first three numbers on a regular die: 

 Topic | Pyramid | Die
 :---: | :---: | :---:
 Knowledge | ![knowledge](http://images.fogus.me/games/pyramid-games/images/pd-puppy.png) | ![knowledge6](http://raw.githubusercontent.com/fogus/spiel/master/pyramidenspiel/gorgias/graphics/die1.png)
 Conduct | ![conduct](http://images.fogus.me/games/pyramid-games/images/pd-philosopher.png) | ![conduct6](http://raw.githubusercontent.com/fogus/spiel/master/pyramidenspiel/gorgias/graphics/die2.png)
 Governance | ![govern](http://images.fogus.me/games/pyramid-games/images/pd-brute.png) | ![govern6](http://raw.githubusercontent.com/fogus/spiel/master/pyramidenspiel/gorgias/graphics/die3.png)

Any constructed argument *must* have at least one each of the three core argument topics.  However, there are other ways to cover these topics without focusing solely on them by the way of *nuanced arguments*.

Nuanced arguments 
-----------------

Nuanced arguments feature combined aspects of the core arguments and are represented as faces on a pyramid or regular die:

 Pyramid | Die
 :---: | :---:
 ![d12](http://images.fogus.me/games/pyramid-games/images/pd-minotaur.png) | ![d4](http://raw.githubusercontent.com/fogus/spiel/master/pyramidenspiel/gorgias/graphics/die4.png)
 ![d31](http://images.fogus.me/games/pyramid-games/images/pd-catoblepas.png) | ![d5](http://raw.githubusercontent.com/fogus/spiel/master/pyramidenspiel/gorgias/graphics/die5.png)

Nuanced arguments are a good way to ensure a powerful case and meet the demands of the three core arguments.

Gameplay
--------

A game of *Gorgias* consists of eight rounds, or *statements*, that consist of five groups of pyramids representing the results of rolling the arguments dice.  These groups are secretly arranged behind a shield across from the opponent's groups.  Once both players' groups are revealed the results are calculated and won pyramids dispersed.

Preparing statements
---------------------

Statements are built by rolling the arguments dice up to three times and keeping any number of dice aside during each roll to formulate the set.  However, the lone caveat in building a set is that each of the three core arguments must be represented either as their exact faces or within nuanced arguments.  Whenever a set is  rolled without represention in all three core arguments then a set of the arguing player's choice will be removed from play for that round.  Finally, once a set is formed via the pyramid dice rolls then the players pull pyramids from a their personal stock of any color of the size needed to fulfill the pyramids shown on the faces of the dice.  Once chosen, the debate can begin.

Debating
--------

The results of the dice describe five groups of pyramids that will be aligned with the opponent's five groups.  Any individual group will consist of a single pyramid or two pyramids.  The pyramid in a group of one can be arranged with its point facing the opposing group or its bottom facing.  When the point of the pyramid faces the opponent's group it projects the value of its pips.  When it faces away from the opponent's group it absorbs the value of its pips.

Before a debate begins the players place a shield between their play areas and secretly arrange their groups in a row.  Once arranged the players reveal their layouts and calculate the argument resolutions.


For example:

![vs](http://raw.githubusercontent.com/fogus/spiel/master/pyramidenspiel/gorgias/graphics/jugg-v-brute.png)

The pyramids above are oriented in such a way that the left-side die projects 3-points of power toward the right-side. However, the left-side die has a 2-point shield facing the attack thus absorbing 2-points of power leaving only 1-point remaining, not enough to destroy it. At the same time, the left-side die projects 3-points of power which is enough to destroy the right-side die.

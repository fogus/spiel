*Gorgias* is a press-your-luck dice game of philosophical debates for two players.  It takes place over the course of seven rounds whereby players roll dice to help build their arguments.  During each round the arguments will be secretly arranged and pitted against the opponent's arguments.  The results of these arguments will help the players score points toward winning the debate.  The most balanced debate wins the game!

Setup of CarboniteDice
======================

![Setup](http://www.looneylabs.com/sites/default/files/IceDice4.jpg)

Plus "carbonite chamber"

Turns in CarboniteDice
======================

You have 10 turns.

TODO

Take a pyramid with pips equal to the turn number.  Swap with any number of pyramids in the bank to equal 10.

TODO

1. Roll the IceDice dice
2. Collect pyramids
3. Continue until you're satisfied with the results

### Freezing pyramids in the bank

If you roll the same color as what you already have in the counter then you *must* remove the sized pyramids shown on the IceDice dice and place them in the "carbonite chamber."  They cannot be accessed again for the remainder of the game.  

For example, if you have a red pyramid in the Counter and the roll of your IceDice dice shows a red spot with a small an medium pyraid face then you *must* remove a small red *and* a medium red from the bank for the remainder of the game.

### Unable to match pyramids

TODO

If you're unable to take a colored pyramid of the specified size from the Bank then you *must* take it from your Vault and add it to the Counter.  If this happens then you (may not want to but you) *must* roll the dice at least one more time.  If you bust out on any subsequent rolls then all of the pyramids, include those taken from your Vault are either returned to the Bank or removed from the game.

### Ending the game

After ten turns calculate your score.

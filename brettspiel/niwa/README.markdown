*Niwa* is a tile-laying area-control game using [Hanafuda](http://www.pagat.com/class/flower.html) cards for 2-players.

Preparation
===========

 * A Hanafuda deck
 * A set of Go stones

Shuffle the Hanafuda cards and deal three cards to each player.  Each player gets all of the stones of a single color.

========

The player with the black stones starts the game.

On each player's turn they must perform the following:

 * Place a card with a stone on top
 * 
 
* place one card with matching stone
* conversion capture
* draw one card

# placement rules

* month matches month orthogonally
* ribbon matches ribbon orthogonally
* creature matches creature orthogonally
* otherwise place it corner-wise to any existing card

*also, majority or tied element can match in enclosed space*

play until each player only has two cards, only those can be played if they result is captures.

the player with the most stones contained in orthogonal groups of at least 2 wins the game

# notes

* can this be played with iota cards?
* can this be played with aquarius cards?
* what happens if we add pyramids instead?
 - does it add a resource mgmt aspect too?

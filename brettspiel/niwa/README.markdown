*Niwa* is a tile-laying area-control game using [Hanafuda](http://www.pagat.com/class/flower.html) cards for 2-players.

Preparation
===========

 * A Hanafuda deck
 * A set of Go stones

Shuffle the Hanafuda cards and deal three cards to each player.  Each player gets all of the stones of a single color.

Gameplay
========

The player with the black stones starts the game.

On each player's turn they must perform the following:

 * Place a card with a stone on top
 * Replace any captured stones
 * Draw a card

Play then alternates between players.

Placement rules
----------------

Cards can be placed either orthogonally or diagnonally to existing cards. You may place any card from your hand that you desire, but if it can be placed orthogonally then it must be.  Cards are placed according to the following rules:

* Cards that match by month can be placed orthogonally
* Cards with ribbons can be placed orthogonally to ribbon cards
* Cards with creatures can be placed orthogonally to creature cards
* Otherwise place it corner-wise any one or more existing cards

### Corner placements

In the case of two cards that form a corner, it's not necessary to match both features in order to place there:

In the case above, any of an animal, October, or November card may be placed in either corner.

### Majority placements

A circumstance may arise where cards placed may create gaps with different matching features.  In these circumstances cards from the hand can be placed according to the majority feature.

*also, majority or tied element can match in enclosed space*

the player with the most stones contained in orthogonal groups of at least 2 wins the game

# notes

* can this be played with iota cards?
* can this be played with aquarius cards?
* what happens if we add pyramids instead?
 - does it add a resource mgmt aspect too?

Preparation
===========

 * A Hanafuda deck
 * A set of Go stones

Shuffle the Hanafuda cards and deal three cards to each player.  Each player gets all of the stones of a single color.

========

The player with the black stones starts the game.

On each player's turn they must perform the following:

 * Place a card with a stone on top
 * Replace any captured stones
 * Draw a card

Play then alternates between players.

Placement rules
----------------

Cards can be placed either orthogonally or diagnonally to existing cards. You may place any card from your hand that you desire, but if it can be placed orthogonally then it must be.  Cards are placed according to the following rules:

* Cards that match by month can be placed orthogonally
* ribbon matches ribbon orthogonally
* creature matches creature orthogonally
* otherwise place it corner-wise to any existing card

*also, majority or tied element can match in enclosed space*

play until each player only has two cards, only those can be played if they result is captures.

the player with the most stones contained in orthogonal groups of at least 2 wins the game

*Malice* is an abstract strategy game of piece movement, capture and teleportation.  

Goal
----

To be the player with the highest captured point total when the game ends.

Materials needed
----------------

Malice requires two special 4x8 gameboards to play, although a checkers board can be used in a pinch.  In addition, Malice requires 18 pawns ([Looney Pyramids](http://www.looneylabs.com/looney-pyramids) work very nicely too) of differing sizes: 6 small, 6 medium, and 6 large.  If you don't have 18 pawns laying around then you can instead use 18 stones or pieces of paper or even coins: 6 dimes, 6 pennies, and 6 nickels.

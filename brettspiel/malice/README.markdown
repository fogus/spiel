*Malice* is an abstract strategy game of piece movement, capture and teleportation.  

Goal
----

To be the player with the highest captured point total when the game ends.

Materials and setup
-------------------

Malice requires two special 4x8 gameboards to play, although a checkers board can be used in a pinch.  In addition, Malice requires 18 pawns ([Icehouse pieces](http://www.looneylabs.com/looney-pyramids) work very nicely too) of differing sizes: 6 small, 6 medium, and 6 large.  If you don't have 18 pawns laying around then you can instead use 18 stones or pieces of paper or even coins: 6 dimes, 6 pennies, and 6 nickels.  The color of the game pieces does not matter, in fact all 18 can be the same color.

In any case, the starting setup for Malice is as follows:

All of the instructions in this guide assume that you're using the special gameboards.

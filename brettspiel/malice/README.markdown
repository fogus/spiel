*Malice* is an abstract strategy game of piece movement, capture and teleportation.  

Goal
====

To be the player with the highest captured point total when the game ends.

Materials and setup
===================

Malice requires two special 4x8 gameboards to play, although a checkers board can be used in a pinch.  In addition, Malice requires 18 pieces ([Icehouse pieces](http://www.looneylabs.com/looney-pyramids) work very nicely too) of differing sizes: 6 small, 6 medium, and 6 large.  You can use 18 stones or pieces of paper or even coins: 6 dimes, 6 pennies, and 6 nickels.  The color of the game pieces does not matter, in fact all 18 can be the same color.

In any case, the starting setup for Malice is as follows:

All of the instructions in this guide assume that you're using the special gameboards.

Gameplay
========

TODO

Piece movement
--------------

The three pawn sizes in Malice move in different ways, as described below.

### Small pawns

Small pawns can move in any direction exactly one square, as shown below:

In other words, smalls move like Chess kings.

### Medium pawns

Medium pawns can move three squares away, in an L-shaped fashion, as shown below:

In other words, mediums move like Chess knights.

### Large pawns

Piece capture
-------------

Capturing in Malice happens much like in Chess.  That is, to capture a piece you need only to move into a square occupied by another piece, but **only** within one of the two opposite quadrants.  A summary of capturing is shown below:

Each captured piece is removed from the board and kept for final scoring, described next.

### Capturing points

Each piece captured is worth points equal to its size:

 * A small is worth 1-point
 * A medium is worth 2-points
 * A large is worth 3-points

Teleportation
-------------

Ending the game
---------------

The game ends when any one of the four quadrants is devoid of pieces.  The player with the most points when the game ends wins.

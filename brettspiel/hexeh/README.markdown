Hexeh is a strategic game of perfect information for two players.

# Needed

 * A hex board (at least 7x7 is recommended)
 * Enough stones to fill the board

# Goal

The player who forms a connected path of their own stones linking their sides of the board wins.

# Gameplay

The first player plays a black stone onto any cell. The second player may choose to either place a white stone onto any other cell or switch colors with the first player. Play then proceeds as follows:

 * Players alternate placing a stone onto any empty cell.
 * If the stone placed forms a palindrome with any connected pieces then the opponent's stones therein may be moved to any empty cells on the board.

## Forming palindromes

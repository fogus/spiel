Anarchism is a Chess variant where individual pieces can move up in rank and whole government are toppled.

Setup
=====

Anarchism is set up exactly like a regular game of Chess.

Additionally, all of the pieces in Anarchism move in the same way that they move in Chess.  The real fun begins once captures occur.

Succession and decline via capture
==================================

In Anarchism, any time that a piece captures another piece the capturing piece immediately becomes the same rank as the captured piece.  For example, observe the following scenario:

![to-capture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fogus/spiel/master/brettspiel/anarchism/graphics/to-capture.png)

If the white pawn on d5 captures the knight on c6 then it will succeed to knighthood:

![knight-capture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fogus/spiel/master/brettspiel/anarchism/graphics/kcapture.png)

The new knight would put immediate pressure on the black queen. Black might likewise capture the new knight:

![knight-capture2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fogus/spiel/master/brettspiel/anarchism/graphics/kcapture2.png)

This time the black pawn succeeded to knighthood.  However, white might decide to capture the new black knight:

![knight-capture3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fogus/spiel/master/brettspiel/anarchism/graphics/kcapture3.png)

The last capture would result in the white bishop declining into knighthood.  Of course, the queen is once again in danger, but the remaining moves are left as an exercise to the reader.

All further capturing in Anarchism happens in this way, except for when the kings capture, which instead cause a coup to occur.

Coups
=====

Anarchism starts with a monarchy in place.  That is, to win the game, a player must checkmate the other player's king -- just like in Chess.  However, should a king ever take another piece then a coup will occur.  A coup describes a change in the government on the board to that representative of the captured (i.e. martyred) piece.  When a coup occurs then **all** of the remaining pieces of that rank must be checkmated in order to win.  The pieces that have performed the coup are effectively the new king for the purpose of winning.

If there is more than one piece of a given rank in power then all but one can be captured.  If a piece in power captures an opponent's piece then another coup will occur.  The only time that a coup does not occur is when a piece in power takes the final piece of a given rank.

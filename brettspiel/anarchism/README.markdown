Anarchism is a Chess variant where individual pieces can move up in rank and whole government are toppled.

Setup
=====

Anarchism is set up exactly like a regular game of Chess.

Additionally, all of the pieces in Anarchism move in the same way that they move in Chess.  The real fun begins once captures occur.

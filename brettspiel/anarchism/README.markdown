Anarchism is a Chess variant where individual pieces can move up in rank and whole government are toppled.

Setup
=====

Anarchism is set up exactly like a regular game of Chess.

Additionally, all of the pieces in Anarchism move in the same way that they move in Chess.  The real fun begins once captures occur.

Succession and decline via capture
==================================

In Anarchism, any time that a piece captures another piece the capturing piece immediately becomes the same rank as the captured piece.  For example, observe the following scenario:

![to-capture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fogus/spiel/master/brettspiel/anarchism/graphics/to-capture.png)

If the white pawn on d5 captures the knight on c6 then it will succeed to knighthood:

![knight-capture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fogus/spiel/master/brettspiel/anarchism/graphics/kcapture.png)

The new knight would put immediate pressure on the black queen. Black might likewise capture the new knight:

![knight-capture2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fogus/spiel/master/brettspiel/anarchism/graphics/kcapture2.png)

This time the black pawn succeeded to knighthood.  However, white might decide to capture the new black knight:

![knight-capture3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fogus/spiel/master/brettspiel/anarchism/graphics/kcapture3.png)

The last capture would result in the white bishop declining into knighthood.  Of course, the queen is once again in danger, but the remaining moves are left as an exercise to the reader.

All further capturing in Anarchism happens in this way, except for when the kings capture, which instead cause a coup to occur.

Coups
=====

Anarchism starts with a monarchy in place.  That is, to win the game, a player must checkmate the other player's king -- just like in Chess.  However, should a king ever take another piece then a coup will occur in the other player's ranks. A coup describes a change in the government on the board to that representative of the captured (i.e. martyred) piece.  When a coup occurs then **any** of the remaining pieces of that rank can be checkmated in order to win.  Any of the pieces that have performed the coup are effectively the new king for the purpose of winning.  The old king becomes a regular piece and can be captured normally.  

The only time that a coup does not occur is when a piece in power takes the final piece of a given rank.

Checkmating the government in power
-----------------------------------

Observe:

![to-coup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fogus/spiel/master/brettspiel/anarchism/graphics/to-coup.png)

In the diagram above, should the black king take the attacking pawn then the following board will result:

![coup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fogus/spiel/master/brettspiel/anarchism/graphics/coup.png)

Unfortunately for white, the coup leads to a catastrophe as the pawn on a2 is placed into check.  When a coup leads to a check then the player in danger has their move to attempt to get out of it.  If they are unable to remove the check then they lose.  In the case above white has no move that can release the check on the a2 pawn and is therefore checkmated.

Types of coups
--------------

The type of coup that occurs depends on the piece captured by an opponent piece in power.  The names of the types of coups are listed below:

 * King taken: Monarchy (also the starting government)
 * Queen taken: Matriarchy
 * Rook taken: Comit√© de salut public
 * Bishop taken: Theocracy
 * Knight taken: A junta
 * Pawn taken: Anarcho-syndicalist

It's fun to yell these names out when a coup occurs.

Assasination
============

If there is more than one piece of a given rank in power then all but one can be captured.  The final piece of a rank in power **must** be checkmated.

Tictactics is a game of palindromic pattern building for two or three players.

Needed: Paper and pen

Goal: To have the most points when the board fills.

Setup: Draw a 5x5 grid on the paper with the center square blacked out. For two players one player plays circles, the other plays squares, and the triangle is neutral. For three players each plays one of the three symbols.

Gameplay: On each turn, players write one of each symbol into any empty cell on the board (the center is not a playable cell). When the board fills up then the scoring begins. 

Scoring: For each palindrome containing your symbol, score points equal to the palindrome's size minus the number of opponent symbols therein. The neutral symbol (2p only) is not considered an opponent symbol. Example: The palindrome CSC for the circle player is worth 2pts. However, the palindrome CTC is worth 3pts. The player with the highest score wins.

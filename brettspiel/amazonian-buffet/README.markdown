*Amazonian Buffet* is a tactical game of blocking and set collection for 2-players.

Preparation

 * A set of Go stones
 * Four pawns, two each of white and black

====

Two win two out of three Poker hands.

Game-play
========

Play alternates between players with the player using the black pieces starting the game.  On each turn, players perform the following actions:

 * Move one pawn any number of cards in possible legal direction
 * Claim a card at one of the intersections of your pawns

The details of movements and claims are as follows.

Movement
--------

A pawn in *Amazonia Buffet* moves like a queen in Chess: any number of possible spaces in all eight directions from where it starts.  The orthogonal directions are simple to visualize but the diagonal directions need further illustration:

That is, when a pawn moves in a diagonal direction it moves along any of the cards connected at their corners in a straight line.  In the illustration above, any of the bold cards can be reached by the pawn starting at the 5 of hearts.

As you might have guessed, pawns may not pass over obstructions along a path such as claim stones or other pawns, nor proceed beyond the edges of the grid.

Claiming
--------

When a pawn finally comes to rest after a move you may claim a card

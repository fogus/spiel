*Noir* is a chess variant requiring a good memory.

Setup
=====

*Noir* is set up exactly like a regular game of Chess, except all pieces will be of the same color:

You can use any color you like, but all of the pieces *must* look exactly the same relative to each other.  The importance in *Noir* is not color but instead indistinguishability.

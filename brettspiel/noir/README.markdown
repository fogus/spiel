*Noir* is a chess variant requiring a good memory.

Setup
=====

*Noir* is set up exactly like a regular game of Chess, except all pieces will be of the same color:

You can use any color you like, but all of the pieces *must* look exactly the same relative to each other.  The importance in *Noir* is not color but instead indistinguishability.

Pieces
======

The game uses the standard set of chess pieces that move in the same way that they move in orthodox Chess.  Indeed, the only rule that changes from orthodox Chess is that when a pawn promotes it can only do so to a captured piece by your opponent.

I'm currently designing three decks of cards and some games for them and when it comes to custom card game designs, there's a multitude of examples for what not to do:

While the games for these decks are indeed fun, I personally cannot help but feel a bit of revulsion when holding these sometimes gaudy, always ham-fisted cards.

Honestly, when it comes to card design, it's very difficult to beat the classics:

However, some modern designs have taken the classic as a starting point and added something special:

The cards above are fresh, clear, beautiful and reminiscent of the classic designs.  Playing the games that these cards were designed for  (and designed around) is a joy.  It's my opinion that beautiful cards can make a game more enjoyable to play.  Of course I shouldn't forget function, which is likely more important.  Beauty and function in card design is not an either-or proposal, indeed they go hand in glove.  However, a functional card is a given but making it beautiful is worth a rating point.

When I get to the point of designing the look of my decks I will strive to make them worthy of the latter set.

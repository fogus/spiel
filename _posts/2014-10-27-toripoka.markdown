Toripoka is a set-collecting, bluffing card game for 2 players based loosely on Three Card Poker played with a truncated deck. The game takes place over a series of rounds, each played to determine the winner of one or both of the pyramids available for capture. Pyramids are captured by players building the best possible three-card Poker hands given three personal cards and two exposed public cards. The player who captures the most points when the pyramids run out wins the game.

This game requires a deck of playing cards and a [Treehouse set](http://store.looneylabs.com/Treehouse).

The rules are on the Icehouse games wiki at <http://icehousegames.org/wiki/index.php?title=Toripoka>

Please consider trying it out.

This is a blog about my adventures in board and card game design.  I will tend to focus on games of abstract strategy and card games, but I'll mix it up a bit if the mood strikes.  I'll also post occassionally about the ideas behind game design.  That said, [my raw game design notes will be kept on my wiki](https://github.com/fogus/spiel/wiki).

I'm a rank amateur at this, so my explorations will be open for all to see.  Feedback is always welcomed at my email address me -at- fogus -dot- me.

The interesting thing about this blog is that it's the next step in my attempt to make my game design efforts open.  I wrote about this a bit in a blog post entitled *[Open Source Game Design](http://blog.fogus.me/2013/10/31/open-source-boardcarddice-game-design/)*, but the culmination of that initial brain-dump exists here.  Additionally, I work through my designs on my [Spiel Github repository](https://www.github.com/fogus/spiel).  Naturally, my designs can only become viable through play-testing, so if you're interested in playing then please do so.  I will respond to feedback [on my Spiel discussion/issues system](https://github.com/fogus/spiel/issues).

Finally, if you wish to follow along then please do subscribe to my [game design RSS feed](http://fogus.github.io/spiel/feed.xml).

Thanks for reading.

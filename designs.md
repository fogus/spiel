I've designed numerous board, dice, and card games -- none of which will you find in your local store.  However, all of the rules are avilable online, free of charge.

 * [Logistics](http://fogus.me/fun/spiel/logistics/) - a Mancala game
 for 2-players with pattern matching goals and capture powers.
 * [Ozymandias](http://fogus.me/fun/spiel/ozymandias/) - a Rummy game
   for the [Das Spiel](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2229/spiel)
   set.
 * [Pidan](http://fogus.me/fun/spiel/pidan/) - a game for the
   [Spiel Mini set](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/110073/spiel-mini)
   inspired by [Inside](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30179/inside).
 * [Podstavec](http://fogus.me/fun/spiel/podstavec/) - a game of blind
   bidding and resource management for 2 or 3. *(entered into the
   [2014 NESTORGAMES RINGS game design contest](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/177816/nestorgames-rings-game-design-contest).
 * [Pew Pew, Die](http://fogus.me/fun/spiel/pewpewdie/) a Martian version of Rock-Paper-Scissors using a 
   die with special faces.
 
More to come.

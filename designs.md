I've designed numerous board, dice, and card games -- none of which will you find in your local store.  However, all of the rules are avilable online, free of charge.

 * [Cydonia](http://fogus.me/fun/spiel/cydonia) - a
   perfect-information trick-taking game of 3d proportions.
 * [Gorgias](http://fogus.me/fun/spiel/gorgias) - a press-your-luck
   dice game of philosophical debating.
 * [Initiative](http://icehousegames.org/wiki/index.php?title=Initiative) - a blocking
   game of perfect information where the last player able to play a
   piece wins.
 * [Logistics](http://fogus.me/fun/spiel/logistics/) - a Mancala game
   for 2-players with pattern matching goals and capture powers.
 * [Malice](http://icehousegames.org/wiki/index.php?title=Malice) - a teleporting capture
   board game for two players.
 * [Natto](http://fogus.me/fun/spiel/natto/) - a climbing game
   for exactly two players.
 * [Ozymandias](http://fogus.me/fun/spiel/ozymandias/) - a Rummy game
   for the [Das Spiel](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2229/spiel)
   set.
 * [Pew Pew, Die](http://fogus.me/fun/spiel/pewpewdie/) a Martian
   version of Rock-Paper-Scissors using a die with special faces.
 * [Pidan](http://fogus.me/fun/spiel/pidan/) - a game for the
   [Spiel Mini set](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/110073/spiel-mini)
   inspired by [Inside](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30179/inside).
 * [Podstavec](http://fogus.me/fun/spiel/podstavec/) - a game of blind
   bidding and resource management for 2 or 3. *(entered into the
   [2014 NESTORGAMES RINGS game design contest](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/177816/nestorgames-rings-game-design-contest).
 * [Quux](http://fogus.me/fun/spiel/quux/) - a tiny connection game.
